However, only about one-third of people with the intestinal disorder seek treatment.\n\n\n\nThe exact cause of IBS remains unknown, and that lack of knowledge has led to the use of a variety of treatments, including fiber supplements, probiotics, antidepressants, behavioral-based therapies, psychotherapy, food modification, acupuncture, and laxatives. However, many treatments are controversial because study results have been mixed.\n\n\n\nNewer and more expensive medications have been introduced to the public, but some were ineffective or withdrawn from the market due to side effects. The recent study sheds light on the cheap and readily available treatments that can help patients, says study coauthor Eamonn M. Quigley, M.D., a professor of medicine and physiology at University College Cork in Ireland.\n\n\n\n\"Medical science has tended to ignore IBS; it wasn't appreciated how much of an impact it can have on a patient's quality of life,\" he says. Health.com: Is that belly ache in your head?\n\n\n\nIn the new analysis, researchers systematically reviewed 38 studies from the last 25 years; more than 2,500 volunteers were involved. That research compared therapies -- all relatively cheap, safe, and readily available -- with a placebo or with no treatment at all.\n\n\n\nThe team looked at three treatments -- soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and antispasmodics, which are drugs that relax the smooth muscle in the gut and relieve cramping -- and found that they were all more effective than a placebo, according to the report in the British Medical Journal.\n\n\n\nBut not all fiber is the same. The soluble fiber ispaghula husk, which is also known as psyllium and found in some bulk laxatives, significantly reduced symptoms of  IBS, particularly constipation; insoluble fiber, such as bran, did not relieve symptoms.\n\n\n\nSeveral antispasmodic drugs helped prevent IBS symptoms, particularly diarrhea. The most effective one was hyoscine, which is sold without a prescription in the United States.\n\n\n\nAlthough peppermint oil was found to be the most effective of the three therapies, more data are needed, cautions Quigley. The peppermint-oil therapy was analyzed in only four trials involving 392 patients.\n\n\n\nBecause past research has been mixed, doctors' treatment guidelines mention the remedies, but don't necessarily give them a ringing endorsement, says author Alex Ford, M.D., a registrar of gastroenterology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\n\n\"I suspect that filters down to the practitioners who don't believe they work, so they try something that's newer or a bit sexier,\" Dr. Ford says. \"The problem with IBS is that it's a chronic medical condition and no drug has been shown to alter its natural history.\" Health.com: Should I be tested for IBS?\n\n\n\nThe study results are not surprising, says Joanne A.P. Wilson, M.D., a professor of medicine in the gastroenterology department at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n\n\nDr. Wilson adds that such treatments are best for patients with mild or moderate IBS. However, in her practice, she's found that prescription medications need to be used for severe cases that don't respond to these treatments.

Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1940s, \"The Adventures of Superman\" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with \"truth, justice, and the American way.\" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them.\n\n\n\n\n\nStruggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 16-episode series titled \"Clan of the Fiery Cross,\" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Donald Duck's scientific breakthrough\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1966, Danish engineer Karl Kr\u00f8yer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls. However, when Kr\u00f8yer tried to license his invention with the Dutch patent office, he was denied. Donald Duck had beaten him to the punch by 22 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Kr\u00f8yer's concept could be traced back to a Donald Duck comic conceived by Carl Barks. In addition to being the most celebrated artist of the Donald Duck comics, Barks was known for his scientific prowess.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo in a 1944 story, when Donald got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius, the duck managed to mumble, \"If I mix CH2 [a methylene compound] with NH4 [ammonium] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog, I should get speckled nitrogen!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it sounded like nonsense, it wasn't. In 1963, chemists P.P. Gaspar and G.S.

For people like that,\" she joked, \"we recommend a stuffed dog.\"\n\n\n\nPortuguese water dogs love the outdoors, particularly if they have a garden to eat from, Teasley said as she wrestled to keep 7-month-old Misty Morning from eating the family's flowers.\n\n\n\nHarding said she believes the first family will be successful with their new dog because \"they have access to the best trainers, and they want to make this work.\"\n\n\n\nFor other Americans thinking about following suit, she cautioned, \"Buyers beware. Do your homework and first read the information on the breed.\"\n\n\n\nTeasley wants people to understand the breed to help avoid what she called the \"Dalmatian syndrome.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the movie \"101 Dalmatians\" came out in 1996, \"thousands of people rushed to get the dog, and thousands of dogs ended up in rescue kennels,\" Teasley said.\n\n\n\nWhat those who followed the Dalmatian trend may not have known is that Dalmatians shed profusely and they develop hearing problems, making it hard to train and call them, she said.\n\n\n\nBoth Teasley and Harding advised owners to get a mentor, as they expect Sen. Ted Kennedy to be to the Obama family. Kennedy owns Portuguese water dogs himself and recommended the breed to the Obamas.  Watch Obamas introduce dog \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"For the first six to seven months of the puppy's life, they need training,\" Harding said.\n\n\n\nShe has diligently trained 8-year-old champion Bessie, who she said \"produces phenomenal litters ... and has multiple titles\" from the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America.\n\n\n\nSuch organizations provide guidance to first-time dog owners.

The findings are published in the February 27 issue of the journal Science and were partially funded by the ALS Association.\n\n\n\nALS, a disease of the nervous system, impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis. It was brought to national attention in 1939, when famed Yankee baseball player Lou Gehrig's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Today, the disease is most commonly known by his name.\n\n\n\nALS6 is a protein normally found inside a cell's nucleus, but in patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps.\n\n\n\nALS researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding, combined with a gene they discovered last year, TDP-43, may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease.\n\n\n\nBoth genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called RNA processing.\n\n\n\nLucie Bruijn, senior vice president of research and development at the ALS Association, likens this process to building an engine: If there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way, the engine doesn't work right.\n\n\n\n\"Everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place, and any imbalance ... can cause things to go awry,\" Bruijn said.\n\n\n\n\"It's exciting because what it's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme,\" Bruijn said. \"We now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in RNA processing is important in ALS. A completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\n\n\nShe believes this gives researchers \"huge\" potential to develop new therapies.\n\n\n\nAnd new therapies are needed.\n\n\n\nThere is no cure and only one treatment for ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

CNN looks at some of the scientific discoveries that changed the world.\n\n\n\nHIV was isolated by scientists in 1983 and named in 1986 by an international committee\n\n\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF HIV/ AIDS\n\n\n\nOriginally called slimmer's disease, as sufferers lost a lot of weight, the first recorded case of HIV occurred in the Congo in 1977. After several infections, a Danish doctor died of pneumonia, which normally doesn't break through the body's immune system. The components of her disease had not yet been placed together, indicating that this was a new form of illness.\n\n\n\nOther cases spread in following years around Africa and in homosexual men in New York and San Francisco. By 1980, 55 American men had been diagnosed with the disease. Research began in Europe, the U.S. and Africa to ascertain what this new disease could be.\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control found that the disease was caused by a virus being passed around by bodily fluids such as semen or blood. In 1981 it published its findings, saying the disease attacked T-cells, which help the body fight infection.\n\n\n\nBy 1983 the disease was isolated by teams of American and French researchers. In 1986 an international committee decided the virus should be called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\n\n\nEducation campaigns were unrolled around the world, advising people to avoid risky sexual behavior or sharing needles.\n\n\n\nBy June 1990, 139,765 people had the disease, with a 60 per cent mortality rate. The progress of the disease slowed down in the West with education campaigns and the development of protease inhibitors, which provided sufferers with almost complete remission. But in Africa, the spread and treatment of HIV remains a global concern.\n\n\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF LITHIUM TO TREAT MOOD DISORDERS\n\n\n\nAustralian psychiatrist John Frederick Joseph Cade once said, \"I believe the brain, like any other organ, can get sick and it can also heal.\"\n\n\n\nHe made huge gains in healing the brain through his work with sufferers of bipolar disorder by discovering that lithium salts -- a naturally occurring chemical - could be used to treat the illness.\n\n\n\nPreviously, electro-convulsive therapy and lobotomies had been the major treatments for bipolar disorder.\n\n\n\nAfter having been a prisoner of war in World War II, Dr. Cade served as the head of the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne Australia. It was at an unused kitchen in Bundoora where he conducted crude experiments that led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. After trials on humans, Dr. Cade speculated that bipolar disorder was a \"lithium deficiency disease\" and that a dose of lithium had a calming effect.\n\n\n\nDr. Cade published findings in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1949 entitled \"Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement.\"\n\n\n\nHe died in 1980. Lithium is still used successfully in the treatment of mental illness to this day.\n\n\n\nTHE DISCOVERY OF BACTERIA\n\n\n\nDutchman Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was known as the \"father of micro-biology.\" He drew scientific attention to the many bacteria that he discovered. His research was helped by the different types of microscopes that he developed over his lifetime. From his powerful lenses he was able to ascertain many different types of lifeforms too small for the human eye to see.\n\n\n\nIt was by observing the build-up of plaque on teeth that the Dutch scientist discovered what we now know to be bacteria.\n\n\n\nHis initial observations on bacteria make for amusing reading. On September 17, 1683, Leeuwenhoek wrote to the Royal Society about the plaque between his own teeth, \"a little white matter, which is as thick as if 'twere batter.\" He then observed two women and two old men who had never cleaned their teeth in their lives.\n\n\n\nLooking at these samples with his microscope, Leeuwenhoek wrote of \"an unbelievably great company of living animalcules, a-swimming more nimbly than any I had ever seen up to this time. The biggest sort ... bent their body into curves in going forwards ...

Nearly 120 alleged drug users from Hong Kong, mostly under the age of 30, were arrested at entertainment venues in Shenzhen in July and held for 15 days in sweeps that made headlines for days here.\n\n\n\nHowever, narcotics police said entertainment venues are not the only places they find drug abuse. \"Forty percent of young people abuse drugs in public toilets and playgrounds.

The pilots will be grounded until they can demonstrate they have been stable for a year, although those who can prove a history of successful medical treatment should be able to fly \"within a few months,\" the FAA said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new policy will \"absolutely\" improve safety, said Randy Babbitt, head of the FAA and a former airline pilot and union chief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The concern that we have today is we have people who are either self-medicating or not seeking a diagnosis. Either of those is unacceptable,\" Babbitt said. \"This change ... will allow those people to get the treatment, allow us to monitor and return them to the cockpit [as] safer, better pilots.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA officials said that they do not know the extent of depression among pilots but that pilots are probably representative of the larger population, in which 10 percent are believed to suffer from depression.\n\n\n\n\n\nNor does the FAA know how many pilots have removed themselves from flying status because they suffer from depression, a condition that now bars them from flying. Nor do they know how many take antidepressants in violation of FAA policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial pilots under the age of 40 are required to undergo a medical exam by an FAA-certified physician every year; those over 40, every six months. But the examination focuses largely on the pilots' physical health, and there is no formal assessment of the pilots' mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FAA says pilots have a regulatory duty and professional responsibility to not fly if they know they have a physical or mental condition that makes them unsafe to fly.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the FAA concedes pilots aren't always forthcoming, especially if honesty could cost them their job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that there are people out there who are not taking antidepressants because they know they would be grounded if they are. We know there are people out there who are taking them and lying to us about that,\" said Dr. Fred Tilton, the FAA's federal air surgeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think it's safer to [make sure pilots are treated for depression] than to continue to drive it underground,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the new policy, the FAA will, on a case-by-case basis, issue special medical certificates to pilots who take one of four antidepressants: fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro).\n\n\n\n\n\nAll four drugs can be used safely without side effects, the FAA said, and other medications will be considered as the agency gains experience and data under its new policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFAA officials say that they have been studying the issue for a decade, and that the change comes with improvements in medication and as the stigma of depression has diminished.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the concerns is the risk of suicide by airplane.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 1993 and 2002, there were 16 \"aircraft-assisted suicides,\" according to a National Transportation Safety Board report, as recounted in a recent FAA medical bulletin. All involved smaller aircraft.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the NTSB ruled that in 1999, the pilot caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 by forcing the plane into the Atlantic Ocean, although the board could not determine the pilot's motives and did not use the term \"suicide.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pilot's medical certificate had been renewed 10 days before the crash.

Fast forward 400-plus years, and we don't really have an official bard, per se -- at least not in corporeal form.\n\n\n\n\n\nNope, if you want to put your finger on the entity that's currently shaping and torquing our lexicon like a game of drunken Twister, you're already there: Look down at your keyboard, and then at the screen and down at your keyboard again. Yup. Our bard would be the internet, breeding ground of such gems as \"BRB,\" \"tweet,\" and, sadly, \"OMG!!!!!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome may call the advent of internet-speak the demise of the English language, and to them we would say, \"STFU.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, \"unfriend\" was deemed the word of the year by the Oxford American Dictionary. So, much like that tattoo of your initials you got emblazoned across your butt last summer after too many G&Ts, this new slang is here to stay.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, Shakespeare coined the word \"puke,\" so it wasn't all sunshine and roses back in the 1500s, anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, there are some internet terms that don't quite translate when applied to real-life situations (or, OK, any situation other than the original and intended one), because they're too obtuse, redundant or just plain stupid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's our take on three of the most awkward phrases and symbols to go from screen to scene:\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\n\n\n\nAh, the hashtag. First introduced into the Twitter lexicon by Chris Messina in 2007, the hashtag was originally a way to tie together common threads of conversation (e.g., Follow Friday, tweets relating to events, news about natural disasters).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, however, the hashtag has also become a way in which to emphasize certain ideas on the microblogging site (\"This weekend has completely murdered my soul #whiskeyandheartache), and, more recently, to denote sarcasm and caustic wit (\"Wow, I really enjoyed that show. Etch-a-Sketch art is totally dope. More free wine, however, would have made the experience much more tolerable. #JustSayin').\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's all well and good in the Twitterverse, but when taken into the real world, the hashtag is a bit harder to hash out.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see, the majority of society -- you know, the people who don't sit in front of their computers tweeting about how \"Eating pancakes makes me feel like death now that I'm 30 #notakidanymore\" -- doesn't understand what the hell you're saying when you tack what amounts to a pound sign onto any given sentence/word in your correspondence (e-mails, etc.). In fact, they could get offended by what you think is an artfully punctuated joke.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen, we do not yet have a symbol that translates into sarcasm (despite lofty efforts by the folks over at Sarcmark), and the hashtag is no exception. So, for now, stick to being caustic and dry, and even then, watch your mouth. Not everyone is socially fluent enough to recognize superior wit when they see it. #JustSayin'...\n\n\n\n\n\n@\n\n\n\n\n\nMoMA's Department of Architecture and Design may have added the \"@\" sign to its collection in March, but the artfully looping symbol has yet to find any real foothold in the conversational realm.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook, it makes sense to add an @ to your name on Twitter, and Facebook now has a handy tagging feature that works with the addition of that particular keystroke, but referring to your friends as \"@Tom\" or \"@T-Bone\" in digital parlance such as e-mail or chat is just ... well ... redundant. You already said their name, so why do you need a directive?\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more egregious is rattling off your Twitter handle in any person-to-person situation (Exception: At tech and social media events this rule is a little less hard and fast, given that your ", "qas": [{"question": "what has become a way in which to emphasize ideas on Twitter?", "id": "ce0c7cc0513b45b6848c3a9b8c01f813", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1650, "text": "the hashtag"}]}, {"question": "What we can use to tag a name on twitter or Facebook?", "id": "5d833472ffb541e59c52411eb2140a6c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3012, "text": "\"@\""}]}]}]}, {"title": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An Afghan political fi", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An Afghan political figure considered vital to peace efforts in the country was assassinated Tuesday, officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurhanuddin Rabbani, a former Afghan president who had been leading the Afghan peace council, was killed in an attack at his home.\n\n\n\n\n\nNATO's International Security Assistance Force said two suicide bombers, \"feigning a desire to conduct reconciliation talks, detonated themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfghan officials earlier said there was one bomber.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attacker hid the explosive device inside his turban, said Hasmat Stanikzai, spokesman for Kabul police.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Afghan intelligence source told CNN that the bomber arrived at the house at the same time a meeting was due to take place between Rabbani and a delegation representing the Taliban insurgency.\n\n\n\n\n\nStanikzai said the bomber claimed to be a Taliban member who had come for the talks about peace and reconciliation, and detonated the explosives as he entered the home.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour other people were wounded, including Masoom Stanikzai, a key adviser to Rabbani, the police spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA doctor at a 400-bed hospital in Kabul said, \"We have received three people from the blast at Rabbani's house.

The man was refused citizenship because he was depriving his wife of the liberty to come and go with her face uncovered, Besson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision, made Tuesday, came exactly a week after a French parliamentary commission recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban -- which has not yet come up for a vote -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools, and on public transport, the commission announced.\n\n\n\n\n\nForeigners may become French citizens if they marry French nationals and meet certain criteria, including integrating well in French society and having \"good morality,\" Besson said.

It even has a rap dedicated to it on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists say the collider is finally ready for an attempt to circulate a beam of protons the whole way around the 17-mile tunnel. The test, which takes place Wednesday, is a major step toward seeing if the the immense experiment will provide new information about the way the universe works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really a generation that we've been looking forward to this moment, and the moments that will come after it in particular,\" said Bob Cousins, deputy to the scientific leader of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment, one of six experiments inside the collider complex. \"September 10 is a demarcation between finishing the construction and starting to turn it on, but the excitement will only continue to grow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe collider consists of a particle accelerator buried more than 300 feet near Geneva, Switzerland. About $10 billion have gone into the accelerator's construction, the particle detectors and the computers, said Katie Yurkewicz, spokewoman for CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which is host to the collider.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the coming months, the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions. It will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year, and the experiments could generate enough data to make a discovery by 2009, experts say.

They also hope to find a theoretical particle called the Higgs boson, which has never been detected, but would help explain why matter has mass.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, when there was a hot \"soup\" of tiny particles called quarks and gluons, to look at how the universe evolved, said John Harris, U.S. coordinator for ALICE, a detector specialized to analyze that question.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this is exploratory science, the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories, but which are just as interesting, said Joseph Lykken, theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When Columbus sails west, he thought he was going to find something. He didn't find what he thought he was going to find, but he did find something interesting,\" said Lykken, who works on the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of six experiments inside the collider complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should the layperson care about this particular exploration?

He also doubled for the actors, including Cruise, during the Southern California shoot of the 1986 hit movie.\n\n\n\nThen a young pilot, Altman had just gotten back from a 7\u00bd-month tour onboard an aircraft carrier when he got the \"Top Gun\" call from his commanding officer.\n\n\n\n\"The skipper of our squadron picked four guys he thought he could trust to have this kind of carte blanche to break the rules a little bit,\" Altman said. That included a scene in which a brazen Navy pilot buzzes the base's control tower. That would never happen in real life, Altman said.\n\n\n\nThe movie features Cruise as a young naval aviator, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, selected to attend fighter-pilot training school at the then-Miramar Naval Station north of San Diego. To prepare for the film, Cruise flew in the backseat of an F-14 several times, including once with Altman.\n\n\n\n\"The actors were all pretty easy to get along with. Tom Cruise, for example, was very motivated,\" recalled Altman, who is making his fourth trip into space this week. \"He enjoyed flying. He listened to what we told him and became a pilot himself after that.\"\n\n\n\nAltman is not one to brag about his flying in \"Top Gun.\" The U.S. space agency, NASA, doesn't mention his film heroics, either.

They would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nParents Moe and Sana Maraachli refused to accept the recommendation. The Maraachlis' daughter, Zeina, had died at home in 2002 after a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications, and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To go through it once is enough for a lifetime, to go through it twice, it's just ... unbelievable,\" Fedor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph was \"very peaceful, in no pain whatsoever, no distress,\" when he died, Fedor said.

Instead, the boy could hear the parents' voices and look for them, Fedor told CNN. The family believed that, after a tracheotomy, Joseph could be freed from machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parents said that they, rather than physicians, should make a judgment on quality of life, Fedor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Maraachli case caught the attention of the group Priests for Life, which funded Joseph's transfer and treatment at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center. That hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and Baby Joseph underwent a tracheotomy there on March 21.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April, Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said he considered this a \"victory over the culture of death.\" He says \"(Joseph) has gained benefit from his tracheotomy, is breathing on his own, and is going home to live with his parents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPriests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization that functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia.

About 10 percent of women who have a mammogram will require more tests.\n\n\n\nAccuracy often depends on patient cooperation, but Reddy reveals there's another side as well: \"A mammogram is only going to be as good as the technician and the doctor who read it, so you want to go to a good place.\"\n\n\n\nA recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that doctors reading mammograms miss an average of two in every 10 cases of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nMedical experts remind women that mammograms alone don't guarantee a clean bill of health.\n\n\n\n\"I wish I could say the mammogram could find 100 percent of breast cancers,\" Reddy said. \"I think we have to rely on having a clinical breast exam once a year at a health care provider and doing your self-breast exam on a monthly basis.\"\n\n\n\nReddy recommends having mammogram screenings at a reputable facility that is certified. She also suggests going to the same office every year so that old X-rays can be compared with new films.\n\n\n\nA convenient location is another factor that makes it more likely that someone will actually show up for an annual mammogram appointment.  Health Minute: Watch more on what to expect during a mammogram. \u00bb\n\n\n\nFear of discomfort is what often keeps some women away.\n\n\n\nReddy advises her patients to schedule a screening appointment for the early part of their menstrual cycle. \"The best time of your cycle to do a mammogram is going to be when your period is over, maybe the week after your period is done when the breasts are not going to be tender.\"\n\n\n\nCaffeinated coffee, tea and soft drinks may also contribute to tender, lumpy breasts. Experts recommend avoiding caffeine for a week before the procedure.\n\n\n\nBefore having any type of imaging test, the Cancer Society warns patients to tell technicians if they think they might be pregnant or are breast feeding.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, reveal any unusual breast symptoms or problems before a mammogram.\n\n\n\nThe screening requires women to undress from the waist up. You'll be given a disposable wrap to put around your shoulders and chest. Wearing a two-piece outfit will make the process easier and more convenient.\n\n\n\nTechnicians tell patients not to wear deodorant, antiperspirants, perfumes or powders. They might leave a residue that can be picked up on the X-rays, interfering with the results.\n\n\n\nAll mammogram facilities are required to issue results within 30 days, but many will contact patients within a week if there is a problem with the mammogram.\n\n\n\nThe Cancer Society recommends women 40 and older get a mammogram every year.

Keller, the group's director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, recalled a visit to rural Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs he passed out the laptops, he kept one eye on the children, the other on his watch. Seven seconds was all it took for an 8-year-old boy to flip open the never-seen-before computer, find and then hit the power button.\n\n\n\nWithin two weeks, that boy and his classmates would be programming.

While the word might conjure images of a massive car accident, replete with broken glass and the Jaws of Life, the reality is sometimes far removed.\n\n\n\nFord's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nIn fact, there are many accidents that produce structural damage such that the vehicle's frame is bent, even though the exterior of the car might even look drivable.\n\n\n\nTypically these cars are \"totaled,\" which might give buyers the peace of mind knowing they will get a replacement vehicle. But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers.\n\n\n\nCar companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation\n\n\n\nThis effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures.\n\n\n\nAnd more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years.\n\n\n\nOne recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department.\n\n\n\nOther car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC.\n\n\n\nThe new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half\n\n\n\nThe goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition.\n\n\n\nTo that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop\n\n\n\nFor Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.\n\n\n\nDuring the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs\n\n\n\n\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer.\n\n\n\nSo, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame.\n\n\n\n\"Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,\" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being \"totaled,\" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states.\n\n\n\nThe success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang.\n\n\n\n\"Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,\" says Bonanni. \"But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers.\n\n\n\n\"That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system ", "qas": [{"question": "What do new materials do?", "id": "cbbd003f83bd456789b0c7a7b0c4ce8f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2839, "text": "truck safer,"}]}, {"question": "What did the Ford expert say?", "id": "75d42bea14c24d5aa35dd3a4af32755c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2967, "text": "\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni,"}]}, {"question": "What will insurers do?", "id": "c3b05d40bfde4641991d458532505bc2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 737, "text": "try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers"}]}, {"question": "What makes the vehicles safer?", "id": "96b41a2772e3491ca5a00d89a09f9712", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2780, "text": "ultra-high-strength steel and boron"}]}, {"question": "What does the Ford expert say?", "id": "e55d296f4a274313b1561742bdfe41c2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2967, "text": "\"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\""}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN)  -- The Tennis Channel has canceled plans to", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- The Tennis Channel has canceled plans to broadcast a tournament in Dubai because an Israeli player was banned.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli tennis player Shahar Peer was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n\n\nShahar Peer, the 45th-ranked women's player according to the World Tennis Association, qualified to compete in this week's Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships but was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates.

Authorities have said the remains are believed to be Caylee's, but an identification is pending.\n\n\n\nSheriff's spokesman Carlos Padilla said last week that authorities believe the remains are Caylee's for three reasons: No other children have been reported missing in the area; the remains are consistent with those of a child of Caylee's age; and the remains were found near the home of the grandparents, where the 2-year-old and her mother were living just before Caylee disappeared.\n\n\n\nFBI spokesman Richard Kolko said Monday that he did not know when tests would be complete, but an attorney for Anthony's parents said the FBI is likely to have results \"within the next week.\"\n\n\n\nCasey Anthony could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted.

What about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up? Did it all kind of work together?\n\n\n\nWare: It does work together. But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.\n\n\n\nWhat it's been is the segregation of Baghdad into these enclaves. It's been cutting a deal with Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of the Iranian-backed militia.

The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the \"bystander effect\": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this \"What's wrong with our children?\" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening.\n\n\n\nTalking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community.\n\n\n\nRather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: \"What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?\"\n\n\n\nThe answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus.\n\n\n\nMake no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it.\n\n\n\nResearch since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events.\n\n\n\nAccording to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, \"I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either.\"\n\n\n\nVirtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is \"a dark alley near the back side of the school,\" the site of the purported rape.\n\n\n\nAs CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area.\n\n\n\nAs important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. .\n\n\n\nResearch shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information.\n\n\n\nThis dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses ", "qas": [{"question": "What did commentators focus on?", "id": "a52bd9f9d68446088b731bfd750f6820", "answers": [{"answer_start": 747, "text": "\"bystander effect\":"}]}, {"question": "what are commentators focused on?", "id": "b36738aa32d44026be321cdf04b08d39", "answers": [{"answer_start": 747, "text": "\"bystander effect\":"}]}, {"question": "what do the studies show?", "id": "016465fabbcb45038bfc279cb8190345", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3682, "text": "students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus."}]}, {"question": "What crime do students not report?", "id": "98141f5f55af44a589cad71ac101cc96", "answers": [{"answer_start": 21, "text": "gang rape"}]}, {"question": "What do studies show?", "id": "5bf5a22842224fe4952ea03b53d31fd3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3677, "text": "that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus."}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- In Focus: Sovereign Wealth Funds\n\nSheikha", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- In Focus: Sovereign Wealth Funds\n\nSheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, Minister of Foreign Trade, U.A.E., talks to CNN about future relations with Washington\n\nWhat a difference a credit crunch makes.

The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds.\n\nDube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend.\n\nNews of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days.\n\nCallers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris.\n\nGallo Records called the death \"senseless and random,\" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was.\n\nSouth Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked.\n\n\"It's very sad,\" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. \"He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists.\"\n\nSutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York.\n\nHis record company said Dube leaves \"a great void\" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans.\n\nBorn outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named \"Lucky\" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies.\n\nDube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career.\n\nIvor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss.\n\n\"Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,\" Haarburger said. \"It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically.\"\n\nDube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle.

In this way you will build something that will stand and endure ... a lasting heritage of reconciliation, justice and peace,\" Benedict said in English to polite applause.\n\n\n\nThe service's Bible reading's \"vivid description of the destruction wrought by war echoes the personal experiences of so many people in this country amid the terrible ravages of the civil war,\" Benedict said in the Mass, which was broadcast by TPA, a CNN affiliate in Angola.\n\n\n\n\"How true it is that war can destroy everything of value: families, whole communities, the fruit of men's labor.\"\n\n\n\nBenedict also expressed \"deep sorrow\" at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in Angola on Saturday, papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said.\n\n\n\nCardinal Tarciso Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, earlier led a Vatican delegation to the hospitals where the bodies of two dead women are being kept, Lombardi said. They prayed over the dead bodies and met with the family of the one victim who has been identified, a catechism teacher in a parish in Luanda whose last class was Saturday morning.\n\n\n\nMidway through the Mass, a long line of worshippers brought offerings to the pontiff, as an electric organ and guitar played a joyous tune over the sound of percussion instruments and a choir, members of which were wearing matching white baseball caps. Women carried local produce on their heads in wide baskets or tall jugs, many dancing to the music as they waited to meet the pope.\n\n\n\nThe 81-year-old pontiff mopped his face with a white handkerchief several times during the outdoor service, while many worshippers sought shelter from the sun under umbrellas.\n\n\n\nThe pope spoke in English and Portuguese, the language of Angola's former colonial rulers, during the hour-long service, while local clergy read short passages in tribal languages.\n\n\n\nBenedict has been in Africa since Tuesday. He returns to Rome on Monday.\n\n\n\nAfrica is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope.\n\n\n\n\"He knows he has to do this. He knows Africa is the future of the [Roman Catholic] Church, as it is for all of Christianity,\" said Gibson. Christianity, like Islam, is on the rise in Africa and Latin America, even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular.\n\n\n\nOne in five of the world's Christians lives in Africa -- up from fewer than one in 50 in 1900, said Brian Grim, an editor of the World Religion Database.\n\n\n\nSo Benedict is making the visit, although travel \"is not his cup of tea,\" Gibson said, in contrast to his predecessor. \"John Paul II loved the travel and loved the different cultures. Benedict is a European through and through.\"\n\n\n\nBut Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of \"The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World.\"\n\n\n\nThe trip opened with controversy, with the pope reiterating the Vatican's opposition to artificial birth control Tuesday while flying to Cameroon, the first stop on his journey.\n\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it.\n\n\n\nGibson said this week's visit may be Benedict's only trip to Africa.\n\n\n\n\"", "qas": [{"question": "Where did 1 million gather?", "id": "5ff70db3c11f4c09b46ec32324df940a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 90, "text": "in Angola"}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the Pope?", "id": "263ac68d0d564969908cdec34ad10b8d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "Benedict XVI"}]}, {"question": "Amount of people gathered to hear the Pope?", "id": "4bd6129a79ac4ba3ae46913fb8243d9c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 22, "text": "1 million"}]}, {"question": "where was the event", "id": "dc1bcf2ea7d34043b9337438ed4acbf4", "answers": [{"answer_start": 93, "text": "Angola"}]}, {"question": "What does the Pope express?", "id": "3eb511ac77664650b1b55a19c630b375", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1041, "text": "Benedict also expressed \"deep sorrow\" at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in Angola on Saturday,"}]}, {"question": "how many dead?", "id": "b83cfc8d017346568f72d0993f32a5bd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1348, "text": "two"}]}, {"question": "Where was Mass?", "id": "ff45f51c967447bbafe8da76140a1a0f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 198, "text": "in Angola,"}]}, {"question": "What continent is the Pope visiting?", "id": "d40052ef1ed24b12a67167b232d8d8e1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 153, "text": "Africa."}]}]}]}, {"title": "(Budget Travel) -- It's all the rage to criticize ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(Budget Travel) -- It's all the rage to criticize the airlines. But we found some smart, practical initiatives that point the way to a better future.\n\n\n\nThis test design for Personal Rapid Transit is part of plans for driverless pods to replace airport shuttles.\n\n\n\nDriverless pods at airports\n\n\n\nSomeday, driverless pods may be zipping passengers between an airport and its parking lots. Fully automated, pods are more convenient than shuttle buses driven by humans. Currently, 18 pods are being tested at London Heathrow's Terminal 5. They let you board when you want to, rather than wait for a bus on a fixed schedule. Punch in your destination, such as a parking lot, on a touch screen. Then leave the driving to the machine, which glides on rails at speeds of 25 mph. A bonus perk: The pods are battery powered, so they don't spew out environmentally destructive exhaust.\n\n\n\nImproved design of coach seats\n\n\n\nHong Kong based Cathay Pacific Airways has reinvented the economy-class seat: As the seat reclines, the bottom slides forward, but the back stays in place. So the passenger sitting behind doesn't have to endure a seat hovering inches from his or her chin. The new seats are especially welcome on long-distance hauls -- which happen to be routes Cathay Pacific flies regularly. American Airlines is among the other carriers reportedly interested in installing similar, slide-forward seats.\n\n\n\nIn-cabin mood lighting\n\n\n\nPoor cabin lighting on a long flight may worsen jet lag. For instance, exposure to bright light at an hour when you are ordinarily asleep can confuse your body's internal clock. But smart cabin lighting may actually help your body adjust to a new time zone -- and beat back jet lag. Virgin America has an in-cabin lighting system that subtly shifts through 12 shades of violet, including a welcoming, bright blue-purple during the day, a softer violet hue after dusk, and a deep, calming near-black on red-eyes when it's time to sleep. Elsewhere in the world, Air Canada, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways offer mood lighting on many long-haul flights.\n\n\n\nLuggage check before you get to the airport\n\n\n\nSchlepping your bags isn't fun. It's also not necessary -- at least not in the many capital cities where you can drop checked luggage at bus or train stations and forget about it until you land at your destination. Many passengers can check bags at London's Paddington station (for Heathrow flights), Vienna's Wien Mitte station, Moscow's Kievsky Station, and Hong Kong Station. In the U.S., the best advance luggage-check option is at Walt Disney World: Guests staying at Disney lodging can check bags at their hotel before hopping on the free Magical Express ride to the Orlando airport.\n\n\n\nPaperless boarding passes  Boarding passes printed on flimsy paper seem almost as outdated as paper airline tickets. Now, cell phone check-in is allowed at many airports, such as Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles's LAX. Punch in your phone number at check-in and a bar code appears on your phone via e-mail or text message. Security officers and gate agents scan your phone's screen, making for an entirely paperless process. Some airlines, including American, Continental, and Delta (plus its sister unit, Northwest), plan to adopt the new technology at every airport gate nationwide.\n\n\n\nMore power --sockets -- for the people\n\n\n\nSometimes it's the simple things that count. Virgin America not only became the first airline to offer Wi-Fi on every flight, but it did so in an especially sensible way, with standard sockets (no adapter necessary) at every seat on the plane. Because while Wi-Fi is nice (even when there's a fee for it), it's even nicer to know that you won't run out of juice in the middle of a flight. Sockets obviously work with portable DVD players and cell phone chargers, too.\n\n\n\nReplacements for outmoded radar-tracking systems\n\n\n\nRadar is outdated. Locating a plane's position can take up to half ", "qas": [{"question": "Which airline has lighting that subtly shifts throughout the day?", "id": "1eb7d127003f4185bd7ffa3cc441685e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1715, "text": "Virgin America"}]}, {"question": "Which airline has in-cabin lighting?", "id": "b71158f3ac6c4380aa5d0ca50b47f0dc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1715, "text": "Virgin America"}]}, {"question": "How many driverless pods were there?", "id": "88d0ad4c27184b2886a42cd1aa074e19", "answers": [{"answer_start": 479, "text": "18"}]}, {"question": "Where are the driverless pods being tested", "id": "513409fabe5141609eff1756de476af0", "answers": [{"answer_start": 282, "text": "at airports"}]}, {"question": "How many pods are being tested?", "id": "1df83e933ab24ff0b54b67700f2cfa1b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 487, "text": "are"}]}, {"question": "What shifts throughout the day?", "id": "8e349996be424e28a5b92a8b05a0d198", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1737, "text": "in-cabin lighting system"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- This week on Inside Africa --\n\n\n\nA photog", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- This week on Inside Africa --\n\n\n\nA photographer's powerful pictures cover the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n\nThen, Nkepile Mabuse catches up with a World Cup legend spreading football excitement in South Africa.\n\n\n\nAnd David McKenzie introduces us to a modest Angolan football squad and looks at the passion behind their play.\n\n\n\nViolence in Congo\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo has been embroiled in bloody conflict for more than a decade.

Its last known contact occurred at 02:33 a.m., the Brazilian air force spokesman added.\n\n\n\nThe assumption is that these electrical problems led to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft's controls.  What brought Flight AF 447 down? \u00bb\n\n\n\nSome experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility, particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ). This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant. Aided by the convergence of the trade winds, the buoyant air rises, releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms.  The airliner's route \u00bb\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN's Mari Ramos, these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over.  Watch more about the weather systems \u00bb\n\n\n\nRetired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms. \"Because safety is the paramount concern, airliners don't fly into storms. They fly around them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"The ITCZ is no different. Planes fly through it every day.\n\n\n\n\"At 8 miles per minute, modern jets can easily fly around storms. Even if they encounter turbulence, they're designed to absorb it.\"\n\n\n\nWhen lightning strikes a plane, the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it, such as a wing tip. Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point, such as the tail. But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded.\n\n\n\nUnlike other aircraft where the pilot's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders, Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a \"fly by wire\" system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces.\n\n\n\nExperts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning. \"If you have a massive electrical problem it's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces,\" said aeronautics expert John Hansman.\n\n\n\nHowever, Kieran Daly, from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, told CNN that this scenario, while not impossible, is inconceivable. \"It's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system. The \"trim tab,\" which enables the pilot to manually manipulate controls such as the rudder, would allow the crew to fly the aircraft safely. \"Pilots are routinely trained for these kinds of events in a simulator,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFormer Airbus pilot John Wiley said on average every airliner is hit by a strike once a year. \"They don't go down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Air France, the ", "qas": [{"question": "What did tthe CEO say?", "id": "2058b653142d477caffeab8b3e29dbcd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 345, "text": "the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday"}]}, {"question": "What encountered heavy turbulence?", "id": "758df4eb23104c66950c66ce7d3a78c9", "answers": [{"answer_start": 345, "text": "the Airbus A330-200"}]}, {"question": "What did the A330-200 encounter?", "id": "3617db7062854907aa937695b18e8696", "answers": [{"answer_start": 377, "text": "heavy turbulence"}]}, {"question": "What did the Airbus A330-200 encounter", "id": "7047a1d5e4564611903f19acd9f2e764", "answers": [{"answer_start": 377, "text": "heavy turbulence"}]}, {"question": "How many people were on the flight?", "id": "1e271a1cce4441378acdeabc701dcb04", "answers": [{"answer_start": 488, "text": "228"}]}, {"question": "How many people where onboard the flight", "id": "97f7bf68a05f48958ef3062ec906f6cb", "answers": [{"answer_start": 488, "text": "228"}]}, {"question": "What did some consider to be a possible cause", "id": "b832de505fb545e2995dfc6e50284d8f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1167, "text": "lightning strike"}]}]}]}, {"title": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- U.S. President-elect B", "paragraphs": [{"context": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- U.S. President-elect Barack Obama announced key members of his energy team on Monday, naming physicist Steven Chu as secretary of energy, and former EPA administrator Carol Browner to a new post in the White House to coordinate energy and climate policy.\n\n\n\nCarol Browner was one of four key environmental nominees named by Obama.\n\n\n\nObama also named Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, to serve as his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Nancy Sutley, the Los Angeles deputy mayor for energy and environment, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality.\n\n\n\nSutley, a prominent supporter of Sen.

Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the hesitance? Because they also understand that a direct attack on President Obama could hurt them in two ways: They could find themselves cut off from the administration or they could anger their base by making the president's job more difficult when he is facing daily attacks from Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven among African-American commentators, columnists and radio and TV show hosts, if you are too harsh on President Obama, the backlash has been swift and vicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organizations know this, and trust me, the White House knows this, and has used it to its advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why I call it the Obama-Black-Two-Step.\n\n\n\n\n\nI've been told countless times by folks on both sides that Obama can't be seen as favoring African-Americans over others, and his White House has been especially scared of touching anything dealing with race.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, black civil rights leaders and prominent Democrats have largely bitten their tongues, unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions. Instead, they quietly fume, mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for. I've been expressly told that some have no interest in working hard or raising money in the fall on behalf of Democrats to hold on to the House and Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Kagan has become a flash point in this uneasy relationship, because this is the second time in a year that President Obama has made a Supreme Court appointment and his administration didn't seriously consider an African-American woman for the job.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court, and it was embraced by civil rights groups. Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the big deal about including a black woman? A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it's vital for Obama to appeal to them. When Obama was behind Sen. Hillary Clinton in the polls, it was because black women hadn't embraced him yet. When they did, the race changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uneasiness with Kagan's appointment among civil rights groups has focused on the hiring record of minorities during her tenure at Harvard Law School, which was followed by the White House pushing back to insulate her from criticism by saying the Harvard faculty makes the recommendations about hiring for tenured positions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were quick to blast out blogs, columns and articles written by African-Americans at Harvard to make clear Kagan is a major advocate of diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a meeting with civil rights leaders and administration officials was held at the White House on Tuesday with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, I was told \"more listening than talking\" was done by the administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCivil rights leaders made clear that they felt they were being taken for granted in the process, and were ", "qas": [{"question": "who is not  considered an African-American woman for high court?", "id": "58b38431dd6a401194b71fafd8326ed9", "answers": [{"answer_start": 27, "text": "Elena Kagan"}]}, {"question": "what are they ticked off ab out", "id": "8e772aa8945a4d19aa6b80ab41e15ef1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 13, "text": "nomination of Elena Kagan to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul"}]}, {"question": "What has ticked off a number of leaders?", "id": "6c064ea2080147e797731b9e36ad5834", "answers": [{"answer_start": 13, "text": "nomination of Elena Kagan to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul"}]}, {"question": "what woman has he considered", "id": "a3961cb61ec74837b21fa52a4f6b518b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 27, "text": "Elena Kagan"}]}]}]}, {"title": "New York (CNN) -- A new report saying that Iran co", "paragraphs": [{"context": "New York (CNN) -- A new report saying that Iran could be secretly working on a nuclear weapon is a major development, but not one that should lead the U.S. to consider a military strike against the Tehran regime, according to analyst Fareed Zakaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe draft report, obtained by CNN and not yet approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors, is the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency's strongest warning yet that Iran could be aiming to build a nuclear bomb.\n\n\n\n\n\nZakaria told CNN the report should spur U.S. diplomacy to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons but that talk by commentators outside the U.S. government of a potential military strike against Iran was wrongheaded. \"To be casually talking about military action because we're getting frustrated seems to me somewhat dangerous,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran's Green Movement of protesters against the regime indicates that waiting could have its benefits, Zakaria said. \"At the end of the day, time is not on the side of this regime.

When it was clear that the company had made an error, it should have done everything in its power to fix it instead of giving you the runaround and forcing you to deal directly with your airline.\n\n\n\nThen again, it should have never come to this. First, why are you phoning an online travel agency to buy tickets? It may be more convenient, but online agencies are built to handle your purchases online. It's more efficient and reduces the chance of an error being introduced -- like misspelling a passenger's name.\n\n\n\nSecond, you should always check your verification e-mail immediately. Expedia could have made a change to your ticket if you had caught the mistake earlier. It's essential that you review your itinerary as soon as possible. Believe me, I know. I just made this mistake and had to spend an extra day at my destination because I put the wrong date in my reservation. (See? It can happen to anyone.)\n\n\n\nI've dealt with too many wrong-name cases to count, and here are a few things I've learned. Passengers aren't turned away at the gate because of a typographical error on their tickets. Reservations systems have limitations that sometimes truncate last names or render non-English names in funny characters. Last names and first names are frequently flip-flopped. Ticket agents, gate agents and security screeners know that, and will let you through.\n\n\n\nI haven't heard of anyone being denied boarding because of a one-character difference in a name. I'm reasonably sure your wife would have been allowed to travel using her ticket, even if this had happened after the May 15 implementation of the first phase of the Transportation Security Administration's \"Secure Flight\" initiative, which requires that you provide your full name as it appears on your government-issued identification.\n\n\n\nIncidentally, the \"notation\" in her reservation would have almost certainly been visible to any connecting airline. And a customs agent wouldn't even pay attention to your ticket under normal circumstances. It's your customs form and passport that matter to them.\n\n\n\nNext time you buy tickets by phone -- and I hope there's no next time -- do yourself a big favor: When you offer your name to the agent, ask to have it spelled back. That way, you'll catch any errors before the transaction goes through. Once you have a reservation, it becomes much more difficult (or even impossible) to make a change.\n\n\n\nIt shouldn't be that way. In an ideal world, you'd be able to change a name on a ticket. Airlines say they can't allow name changes for \"security reasons\" but I'm inclined to believe it has more to do with the fact that they ", "qas": [{"question": "Where did the passenger purchase airline tickets from?", "id": "e2b5d2e3dba846f2b501f617fbda65eb", "answers": [{"answer_start": 75, "text": "Expedia."}]}, {"question": "What did the passenger purchase?", "id": "0b6a31e91402412db37498cbbf45f68c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 51, "text": "two tickets to Italy"}]}, {"question": "What travel company issued a corrected ticket?", "id": "50df16ae2a574f7c9140cd8242b98a90", "answers": [{"answer_start": 75, "text": "Expedia."}]}, {"question": "What was misspelled when received the tickets?", "id": "af70919c8e954162a4fed9325ffff0d4", "answers": [{"answer_start": 112, "text": "his wife's name,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in the case of a man accused of sexually assaulting a toddler and capturing it on videotape years ago, a crime that triggered a nationwide manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child.\n\n\n\nChester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor.

As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said.\n\n\n\nProsecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage.\n\n\n\nPicking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: \"As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?\"\n\n\n\n\"One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,\" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC.\n\n\n\n\"However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision.

On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted.\n\n\n\nAfter attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007.\n\n\n\nAn attorney for the child's mother said she is 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before her third birthday while she was in the care of a baby sitter her mother had hired, he said.

If I lived in \"Mad Men\" land for a day, I would totally make out with him on his Sterling-Cooper purchased desk. In real life? Not so much. At least not anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Draper of \"Mad Men\" is a complicated man underneath a confident exterior, columnist warns.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Don Draper so drool-worthy on screen does not translate in real life. Actually, certain things do translate -- tall, dark and handsome is still tall, dark, and handsome in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that aloof, secretive, and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show's viewers? Not easy to live with.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon Draper is written as an extremely complicated and deeply flawed man who does some awful things, like cheating repeatedly on his wife, Betty, and using information he gleans from her therapist to manipulate her.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode. As with any TV show or movie, we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does, and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind \"Mad Men\" will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who Don Draper is and how he will evolve into a better man.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn real life, such life-changing revelations don't always come.\n\n\n\n\n\nI dated a Don Draper-type for years. There were superficial similarities, like that they both worked in similar industries (just decades apart) and had a knack for always being \"on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuys like Don Draper are great at their jobs for a multitude of reasons, but one of them is that they present themselves as calm, collected, and unmoved by the opinions and emotions of others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a business situation this comes across as professional, confident, and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly. In a real-life romantic relationship, the refusal or inability to \"turn it off\" can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful. When you're in love, having that power only makes you feel even more special. The Frisky: 10 things women don't understand about men\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are reasons why Draper's wall is so high and impenetrable. Knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him. There's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior! A man with secrets so big, he has to hide behind a wall all of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetty Draper may not know Don's secrets, but they do share a bond he doesn't have with other people. The women he cheats with? They don't know him at all and they don't have the ability or even the interest in seeing something deeper like Betty does.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're not threatening to his persona, but she is. These are, of course, just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy ex had his own reasons for presenting a facade, for not letting anyone get too close, for acting like a jerk; some he shared, some I figured out, but all made me want to stay with him. The Frisky: Could you get past hearing \"I don't love you anymore?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know if my Draper-esque ex cheated -- though I suspect he did -- but I do think he broke up with me because I was a threat.

Russia's concerns also align with those of some NATO members who oppose welcoming Georgia and Ukraine into the fold.\n\n\n\nPifer said last month that NATO should strive to maintain good relations with Russia, but \"should not allow Moscow a veto, either explicit or tacit, over relations between the alliance and third countries.\"\n\n\n\nAllowing Russia a say, Pifer said, \"would encourage those in Russia who wish to reassert a Russian-led post-Soviet bloc rather than develop a relationship of cooperation and full partnership with Europe and the West.\"\n\n\n\nBush said he phoned Putin recently to reassure him on both issues.\n\n\n\n\"NATO is an organization that's peaceful.

The following is an edited version of that interview:\n\n\n\nCNN: To someone who's never read your books before, how would you describe your style?\n\n\n\nGregory Maguire: I would describe [my books] as being, not quite allegories, but commentaries on contemporary society -- and indeed politics to some extent -- enshrouded in, and disguised by, the guise of children's stories.\n\n\n\nIn other words, I use children's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers who say this is going to be easy ... and it's going to be fun. And indeed I hope it is fun. But once I get people involved in the plot, I hope to also communicate some of the questions I have about the way we live our lives in the 21st century.\n\n\n\nCNN: Talk to me about Brrr. What's his personality like? What is he going through?\n\n\n\nMaguire: Well, Brrr is the name that I've given to the cowardly lion who is the main character -- the protagonist -- in this novel called \"A Lion Among Men.\" And I gave him that name for two reasons: One, because it does sound like a shiver, and he is always slightly spooked by the world; and the second reason, because the two letters in it B-r-r-r are both letters from the name of Bert Lahr, who played the Cowardly Lion so famously in the 1939 MGM film.\n\n\n\nHis character arises in the hollow space in our perceptions between that giant roaring lion at the MGM logo ... the ideal lion, and the kind of sad, sacked, out of work, vaudeville performer in lion pajamas that we see when Dorothy actually runs into the lion on the Yellow Brick Road.\n\n\n\nIn other words, there's a huge disconnect between the image we project of ourselves -- the best we might ever hope to possibly be -- and the way we feel about ourselves at our absolute worst -- when we're the most down in the dumps. There's a huge space in between there. So the novel's really in some ways about character and taking control of the destiny of your own character.\n\n\n\nCNN: Everyone knows of your success with \"Wicked\" -- it's huge.

The program lets people bark commands or ask questions to the phone, and it will provide an answer or ask follow-up questions in order to perform a given task.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the news conference, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing executive, called Siri \"the coolest feature of the new iPhone 4S,\" and the company is expected to advertise Siri heavily in its sales pitches.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple dedicated a significant chunk of the presentation to showing the extent of Siri's ability to interpret requests and respond. \"Do I need a raincoat today?\" incites a robo-female voice to reply: \"It sure looks like rain today,\" as Scott Forstall, Apple's mobile software executive, demonstrated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk Siri to remind you to buy flowers for your wife at a certain time, and Siri may ask you to identify her in the phone's address book. Siri then remembers who she is for future requests, Forstall said. The software integrates with Yelp and WolframAlpha for relevant queries. It can also schedule appointments in the phone's calendar and transcribe e-mails or text messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Google's Android phones, users can dictate messages, too, which are then transcribed by Google's servers. Other cell phones support voice commands, which is handy when operating a phone while driving, but few people take advantage of the option. Even the preceding iPhones had a basic version of this called Voice Control, which can be activated in the same way as Siri, by holding down the phone's home button.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Apple's ambitions for Siri are much greater.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Jobs has said that Siri's focus is on artificial intelligence. \"We like what they do a lot,\" the Apple co-founder and former CEO said at the AllThingsD conference last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nForstall echoed that onstage Tuesday, saying: \"I've been in the AI field a long time, and this still blows me away.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big unveiling of the iPhone 4S on Tuesday was the first time most people learned about Siri, but the voice-assistant software is rooted in many years of extensive technical research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project was born at SRI International, a nonprofit research organization. It was a part of an ambitious project called CALO, for Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes. The program was funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the government division responsible for Global Position System (GPS) and developments that led to the creation of the Internet.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork on Siri began in the summer of 2007, and SRI executives decided to spin out the project as a standalone business in 2008. Apple acquired the company in April 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The team was so happy when Apple did the acquisition,\" Norman Winarsky, a Siri co-founder who remained at SRI, said in an interview on Monday. \"They have a vision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore joining Apple, Siri provided a free app for iOS mobile devices. Apple removed it from the App Store on Tuesday, which means only iPhone 4S owners will be able to access the service starting next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe version integrated into the 4S is vastly superior to the now-defunct app based on onstage demos. Apple spokespeople did not respond to CNN's requests to try the product at the event on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nSiri's engineers were excited for the opportunity to bake their software deeply into the new iPhone and build features that a third-party developer would not be able to do because of Apple-imposed restrictions, Winarsky said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are going to be very proud,\" he said. \"The world of virtual personal assistants is going to be everywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSiri's specialty is in its ability to interpret so-called natural-language requests.

Omaha, Nebraska, on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"This is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate,\" said Don Greene, a former FBI agent who has written a book on mall security.\n\n\n\n\"If the people closest to him didn't see any indicators or signs that he was going to go off so drastically ... how is some public safety officer supposed to recognize this person?\" Greene asked.\n\n\n\nIn fact, security at Omaha's Westroads Mall did find Hawkins' behavior suspicious before the shooting, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Thursday.\n\n\n\nMall surveillance initially flagged Hawkins \"based on his actions\" when he entered the mall through the Von Maur store's main entrance on the second floor, Warren said. He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt.\n\n\n\nHe then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said.  \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" he said.\n\n\n\nShopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.  Watch what experts say about keeping malls safe \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"There is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens,\" said Malachy Kavanaugh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible.\n\n\n\nThere are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers. Although some include police substations, most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards.\n\n\n\nShould these private security guards be armed? \"Absolutely not,\" said Greene. Greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall, it could result in \"the gunfight at the 'OK corral,' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight.\"\n\n\n\n\"These random events are very challenging to prevent and difficult to deal with when they occur. Law enforcement and security prevention measures, no matter how good, cannot forestall a tragedy such as this from happening,\" said a statement issued Wednesday night by the Simon Property Group, which operates regional and outlet malls across the United States.\n\n\n\n\"We do not disclose or discuss our enhanced security measures and/or procedures that we have in place or may institute at any given time, some of which are visible to the public, with others intentionally less noticeable,\" the statement said. \"Disclosure of such information could potentially compromise our efforts to provide a safe and secure environment.\"\n\n\n\nSecurity expert Lou Palumbo told CNN one useful strategy was having trained law enforcement personnel watching people as they enter the mall.\n\n\n\n\"You start to observe the people coming into the mall area,\" he said. \"To let them in your door and then try to figure out what they're doing, you know, it's not as effective as catching them as they're coming in the door.\"\n\n\n\nThe International Council of Shopping Centers has conducted focus groups with shoppers to test how they would react to even tighter \"airport style\" security measures, including bag checks and magnetometers.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the results have shown that shoppers would accept the measures only if the national threat advisory system was raised to its highest level, red. Such extreme measures are \"in the mall industry playbook ... but it is something no one wants to do,\" said Kavanaugh.\n\n\n\nWhile some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems, many security experts believe more should and can be done.

The Justice Department said Tuesday that federal prosecutors have been in contact with the state police and FBI as well as county prosecutors and the department's own Civil Rights Division.\n\n\n\n\"In support of the Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office, which intends to retain lead responsibility for the criminal investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office will provide guidance and legal advice to the officials looking into the death and seeking to develop evidence of criminal violations,\" the department said in a written statement.\n\n\n\nJohnson said Monday that he had requested that the Maryland State Police conduct an independent investigation into White's death.\n\n\n\nWhite family attorney Bobby Henry said there are only two ways someone could get into solitary confinement.

None has been suspended or removed.\n\n\n\nThere were no surveillance cameras in the area of the jail where White was being held. White had not had the opportunity to meet with an attorney, Henry said.\n\n\n\nA physical conducted when White was processed revealed no health issues, according to Johnson. He was checked regularly in his cell and appeared fine when corrections officers saw him at 10:15 a.m. Sunday. When officers brought him lunch 20 minutes later, he was unconscious and without a pulse, Johnson said.\n\n\n\nHenry said White's family was not notified of his death until several hours after it occurred. They were told to go to Prince George's Hospital to identify the body, he said, but upon arrival were told the state medical examiner's office had taken custody of the body and it had been taken to Baltimore.\n\n\n\n\"At this very moment, the family has not even seen the body of their loved one,\" Henry said. \"They have been denied the opportunity to start the grieving process which naturally must occur.\"\n\n\n\nHe said White's family is calling upon the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Maryland State Police and county officials \"to conduct a thorough and exhaustive investigation into all of these tragic events, beginning with the events of Friday, June 27", "qas": [{"question": "Who opened civil rights investigation?", "id": "5d8a6ddd00ff46a4a68fb56507cd76ce", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1116, "text": "FBI's Baltimore field office"}]}, {"question": "Who is being held for the death of a police officer?", "id": "8b7525de970c4f40865c6e5c3dc89500", "answers": [{"answer_start": 161, "text": "Ronnie White,"}]}, {"question": "What type of investigation did the FBI open?", "id": "b5ffedbec441477fa239e782fb628236", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1166, "text": "civil rights"}]}, {"question": "Who has been held following the death of police officer?", "id": "287c319b65094d23809ba1563ec3e70e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 161, "text": "Ronnie White,"}]}, {"question": "What did Ronnie White die of?", "id": "16210271258f4a84b1dd5f0e13449d6d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 187, "text": "strangulation and asphyxiation"}]}, {"question": "Where was Ronnie White?", "id": "9da90ceaca2f41d6a8aab4bf02a599df", "answers": [{"answer_start": 379, "text": "Prince George's County Correctional Center,"}]}, {"question": "Where was White being held?", "id": "67f03659bf904f96b7c75c168e76bbc1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 379, "text": "Prince George's County Correctional Center,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Now that Caylee Anthony's remains have be", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Now that Caylee Anthony's remains have been identified, the search for the Florida toddler turns into a prosecution of her mother.\n\n\n\nCasey Anthony, 22, is accused of killing her daughter. Investigators say her alibi didn't check out.\n\n\n\nAlthough Orange County, Florida, Medical Examiner Jan Garavaglia said Friday she could not determine how Caylee died, she concluded the death was a homicide.\n\n\n\nThe child's mother, Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including murder in the disappearance and death of Caylee, who was 2 when she vanished last summer.\n\n\n\nThe remains were found last week in woods about a half-mile from Anthony's parents' house and identified through DNA testing.

Legal experts say duct tape reportedly found on the body could convince a judge or jury that Caylee's death was not an accident.\n\n\n\nPerhaps of greater significance, though, is Casey Anthony's behavior since -- and even before -- her child went missing.\n\n\n\nAccording to earlier reports, Caylee was the result of an unintended pregnancy, and Anthony made an attempt to give her up after birth. She referred to Caylee as \"the little snot head\" and continued to maintain an active social life.

Anthony told conflicting stories at the beginning of the investigation, including a tale that Caylee was with a nanny. The name and address turned out to be bogus. As police searched for Caylee, they say Anthony's active social life continued -- including one memorable evening dancing at an Orlando bar that was hosting \"Hot Body Contest.\"   Investigators said they found the scent of decomposing flesh and a trace of chloroform, a powerful knockout agent, in the trunk of a car Anthony drove at the time. Anthony's family offered various explanations, including a rotting pizza and a dead squirrel.

Or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries. Because, in the end, he's Ralph Lauren, and we're not.\n\nRalph Lauren has his eye on China and Japan.\n\nFor four decades no other designer has had a greater impact, not only on the way American men and women dress but also on the way they imagine, seek and indulge in the Good Life, than the former tie salesman from the Bronx.\n\n\"Those ties were handmade, by the way,\" recalls Lauren. \"Back then, ties, even designer ones, didn't sell for more than $5 apiece. Mine were $12 to $15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary.\"\n\nAnd ironic. Because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because \"it was the sport of kings. It was glamorous, sexy and international.\"  See his designs \u00bb\n\nIn the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial. Lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal.\n\nWhat's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase.\n\n\"What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,\" says the designer.\n\n\"When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality. And it's an image that can change, that can evolve. It doesn't reinvent itself every two years.\"\n\nHowever, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy.\n\n\"The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,\" Lauren admits. \"And that's fine. But the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else. We work real hard at that. It's about getting your message out to the consumer. It's about getting their trust, but also getting them excited, again and again. My clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- aren't concepts. They go into stores. Our stores. Thankfully, we have lots of them,\" says Lauren.\n\n\"What I rely on is people walking into my store saying, 'I want your clothes.'\"\n\nWell, if all of Lauren's customers shouted that together, he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers.\n\nLauren's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere. It furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables.

It wasn't long before he took his talent out of the bedroom, playing with high-school band The Iguanas, from which he later took his stage name.\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1965, Iggy formed a blues band called the Prime Movers. Following a brief stint at the University of Michigan he moved to Chicago, playing drums with local bluesmen, before returning to Michigan with his sights set on fronting a rock band.  Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn 1967, he recruited guitarist Ron Asheton, his drummer brother Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander and formed The Psychedelic Stooges.\n\n\n\nIt was after seeing the Doors in concert, and inspired by Jim Morrison's confrontational stage persona, that James Osterberg reinvented himself as Iggy Pop, a drug-fueled, crazed whirling dervish of a front man, who would strut semi-naked around the stage, roll around in broken glass and dive headlong into the audience.\n\n\n\nThe band shortened its name to The Stooges and released its eponymous debut in 1969. Right from the start there was clearly something different about Iggy Pop. At the height of flower power, when The Stooges' contemporaries were singing about peace and love, Iggy was singing \"No Fun\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Dog.\"  See photos of Iggy in action. \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe album was a brilliant mess of raw, blues-influenced garage rock, but it sold poorly, as did the 1970 follow up \"Fun House,\" later described by Jack White of the White Stripes as \"the definitive rock album of America.\" Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami\n\n\n\nBy this time, Iggy had begun the Heroin use that would plague his career and in 1971, The Stooges split up after being dropped by their record label. That same year, Iggy met David Bowie, who took him to England, re-united The Stooges and produced 1973's \"Raw Power.\"\n\n\n\nWith \"Raw Power,\" Iggy and the Stooges created the blueprint for punk rock and made an album that would one day be regarded as a landmark in rock music, an album that Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain listed as his favorite of all time. Nonetheless, it was another commercial failure and in 1974, The Stooges split again.\n\n\n\nBy this time, Heroin had taken over Iggy's life and in 1975 he checked himself into a Los Angeles mental institution in an effort to kick the habit. Bowie visited him there and took Iggy along on his 1976 tour, before the pair moved to West Berlin in an effort to get away from the temptation of drugs.\n\n\n\nIt was there that Bowie produced and co-wrote Iggy's 1977 solo albums, \"The Idiot\" and \"Lust for Life.\" The latter included the songs \"The Passenger\" and \"Lust for Life,\" which have since become staples of TV ads and movie soundtracks, spawning countless cover versions.\n\n\n\nMore commercial than The Stooges' records, Iggy's solo albums were met with critical acclaim and better sales, but never breakthrough into the mainstream. Songs that Bowie wrote with Iggy during this period were later included on Bowie albums, with \"China Girl\" becoming a hit single for Bowie.\n\n\n\nIggy carried on touring and releasing albums throughout the 80s, without much commercial success, although the single \"Real Wild Child\" was a hit in the U.S. and UK.

Richard Phillips was rescued, the piracy incident was discussed as one of the \"tests\" of President Obama that Joe Biden warned about during the campaign.\n\n\n\nOthers wondered whether wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched our military resources too thin to respond effectively to these kinds of provocations. Many expressed outrage at the brand of naval gangsterism that by some estimates generated as much as $80 million in 2008.\n\n\n\nClearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis. But what this situation actually reveals is how little we've learned in the nearly eight years since George W. Bush declared war on terror.\n\n\n\nSomalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward. The United States supported the government of Said Barre during the 1980s primarily for the same reason we began funneling aid to the Afghan rebels: anticommunism.\n\n\n\nBarre was a regional counterpoint to the Marxist regime next door in Ethiopia and strategically important enough for his human rights abuses to be tolerated. And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support.\n\n\n\nDuring the early post-Cold War era, the United States developed a more narrowly defined set of interests and it was common to hear American foreign policy circles express disdain for \"nation-building\" projects. But two decades later we continue to deal with the consequences of our abrupt exit from both countries.\n\n\n\nOur fleeting humanitarian concern with Somalia ended with the downing of two Blackhawk helicopters in 1993. But that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to Afghanistan: The forces that attacked American troops in Mogadishu were reportedly linked to al Qaeda.\n\n\n\nThe 9/11 attacks and Afghanistan's role in sheltering al Qaeda should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place. In short, we might well have looked at what was going on in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and seen trouble on the horizon elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe Somali situation was further complicated by a series of economic and ecological problems that have struck the region in the past decade. In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing. This is a problem across East and Southern Africa but rampant in Somalia. According to one report, some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion.\n\n\n\nAs recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse. To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, U.N. officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore. The situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences.\n\n\n\nNo matter what we think of their current methods, it's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue. Somalia lacks a functioning navy -- or government. Similarly, we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind.\n\n\n\nThese environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the West has more or less ignored Somali pleas. Our intense and highly selective outrage began when the Somalis started targeting commercial vehicles.\n\n\n\nFaced with this response it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products, carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives.\n\n\n\nGiven the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder ", "qas": [{"question": "What is a test of obamas policy?", "id": "36c255f124334df8baabb2e913aefc6f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 508, "text": "the piracy incident"}]}, {"question": "Who cared about Somalia?", "id": "c0412b5c73f744608255bd12ebf67d3b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 225, "text": "William Jelani Cobb"}]}, {"question": "What did Cobb say?", "id": "38af62bfb6eb48a8b4937f1d7ca7ac09", "answers": [{"answer_start": 250, "text": "Somalia's piracy problem was fueled by environmental and political events."}]}, {"question": "What is said to have caused piracy?", "id": "283449da34f24389b1967779d0ed4dfd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 289, "text": "environmental and political events."}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Iran could see widespread protests this w", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Iran could see widespread protests this weekend, as a day of mourning for the most prominent cleric to oppose the regime coincides with the major Shiite holy day of Ashura.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran -- whose regime exists as an explicitly Shiite Muslim leadership -- may find it politically and culturally difficult to put a lid on the marking of Ashura this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt falls on Sunday -- which happens to be a week to the day since the death of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution.

But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee.\n\n\n\nIt's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\nBut for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived.\n\n\n\nTarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store.\n\n\n\nShirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain.

Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants.\n\n\n\nIt's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity.\n\n\n\nBut Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo.\n\n\n\nVisitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible.\n\n\n\n\"In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,\" Buckley said. \"People have their own emotions, that energy,\" Buckley said. \"If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy.\n\n\n\nFor Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra.\n\n\n\nStudying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,\" she said. \"When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them.\n\n\n\n\"And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants.\"\n\n\n\nFrom years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born.\n\n\n\n\"We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,\" Blais said.\n\n\n\nAt the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff. They share space with deer, wild turkey, raccoons, skunks and other native Tennessee animals.\n\n\n\nLife in a circus, and in most zoos", "qas": [{"question": "Where is the sanctuary located?", "id": "c2259f85230746369c272c79f271f791", "answers": [{"answer_start": 535, "text": "rural Tennessee."}]}, {"question": "Where is the Elephant Sanctuary?", "id": "d3ae3c08aad44cbda0ba4bf1b82fca1e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 535, "text": "rural Tennessee."}]}, {"question": "is the site open to the public?", "id": "3040bd06744c435a980080d34055f300", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1862, "text": "Visitors aren't allowed"}]}, {"question": "What takes in old, injured, and abused animals?", "id": "d6c2f7abf2414aa78c2c2bf6213d7d29", "answers": [{"answer_start": 271, "text": "The Elephant Sanctuary."}]}, {"question": "What size is the facility?", "id": "cae2fe78dae544d3a5bf2c2eb3919562", "answers": [{"answer_start": 511, "text": "2,700-acre"}]}, {"question": "When was the facility opened?", "id": "a2fec7feaca844cc8b0c63711b785de5", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1288, "text": "1995"}]}]}]}, {"title": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The woman who received ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The woman who received the first-ever near-total face transplant in the United States told her doctor she has regained her self-confidence, said Dr. Maria Siemionow, head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland Clinic and leader of the transplant team.\n\n\n\nThis illustration represents the transformation of a patient who underwent a near-total face transplant in December.\n\n\n\nThe patient, who prefers to be anonymous, is finally able to breathe through her nose, smell, eat solid foods and drink out of a cup, Siemionow told participants of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago over the weekend.\n\n\n\nThe complex surgery, a 22-hour procedure, took place in December at the Cleveland Clinic.

In the future, however, lifelong immunosuppression may not be required, she said.\n\n\n\nWhile burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person's own body, this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp, Siemionow said.\n\n\n\nPreviously, three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China.

And we should all agree that sometimes, in the name of national security, it is necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the American people.\n\nHowever, I and many others believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention have not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security.\n\nIn this global counterinsurgency effort against al Qaeda and its allies, too often our means have undercut our efforts by wasting one of our best weapons: the legitimacy that comes from our moral authority.\n\nTorture plays directly into a central tenet of al Qaeda's recruiting pitch: that everyday Muslims across the world have something to fear from the United States of America.\n\nFrom Morocco to Malaysia, people regularly hear stories of torture and suicide at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and other overseas prisons. The result has been a major blow to our credibility worldwide, particularly where we need it most: in the Muslim world.\n\nOnce permitted, torture and lawlessness are not easily contained. Coercive interrogation techniques found their way from high-level terrorists at Guantanamo to low-level detainees at Abu Ghraib.\n\nYears later, images of abuse there remain fixtures across the Arab and Muslim world. And as John McCain has argued, the use of techniques like waterboarding leaves its scars on a democratic society as well.\n\nTorture elicits lies -- not just from those experiencing it, but from those who seek to conceal it. After years of Orwellian denials and legalistic parsing, what a relief it was to hear our new attorney general-designee finally acknowledge what we know to be true: that yes, \"waterboarding is torture.\"\n\nAs we move forward, President Obama is wise to \"reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals\" -- but the American people should know that closing a prison conceived outside the rule of law will not be easy.\n\nReclaiming Guantanamo and its inhabitants into our legal system from what former Vice President Dick Cheney called \"the dark side\" will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and policy issues.\n\nHowever, we are already seeing the international system reorganize itself around an America that is willing to be a moral leader. Countries such as Portugal and Ireland have made welcome offers to join Albania in resettling detainees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Already we are seeing the fruits of a good faith effort with our allies.\n\nStill, it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles, many handed over from the previous administration: looming questions about the inadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced; the difficulty of returning detainees -- including many cleared for departure -- who would face torture or worse in their home countries; and the fact that we already know some released from Guantanamo have returned to the battlefield.\n\nIn some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we know to be extremely dangerous to the American people.\n\nAnd even as we embrace long-overdue change, we owe it even to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge the urgency of the moment they inherited, the sacred responsibility to protect American lives which they strove to honor, and the humbling reality that there are no easy ", "qas": [{"question": "What weakened us security?", "id": "afbbc141253142fab6d2b697ae4ee6fe", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1231, "text": "the use of torture and indefinite detention"}]}, {"question": "What did John Kerry say?", "id": "766f91b668a7407690874162a7f1bf7c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 153, "text": "Barack Obama sent a message that fight against terror will respect America's values."}]}, {"question": "what was the law", "id": "4ca71c2aabe54b088ede58a422a56ec6", "answers": [{"answer_start": 293, "text": "the rule of"}]}, {"question": "What was president Obama's message?", "id": "aa17174e9fd54409b297cb9ea0371333", "answers": [{"answer_start": 181, "text": "that fight against terror will respect America's values."}]}, {"question": "what was the decision", "id": "c1ade6f519404356a8aa9a474c20374e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 421, "text": "eventual closure of Guantanamo Bay prison"}]}]}]}, {"title": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Kenneth Cole is the first to adm", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Kenneth Cole is the first to admit he has a bit of a language problem.\n\n\n\nPun-loving Kenneth Cole pays tribute to inspiring people in his new book.\n\n\n\n\"I need to distort not just leather and fabric, but also words,\" he said. \"It's a disorder I have.\"\n\n\n\nThe pun-loving fashion designer has raised plenty of eyebrows with advertising copy that ranges from the provocative and the political to the lighthearted and cutesy.\n\n\n\nBrowse his online store and you can buy a T-shirt that reads \"In war is it who's right, or who's left?\" A canvas tote bag says, \"Use me again and again and again ...

of sumo wrestling like a colossus.\n\n\n\nAsashoryu is one of sumo's most successful, and most controversial, wrestlers.\n\n\n\nBut the 330-lbs Mongolian, sumo's most successful ever grand champion, has not been able to rise above the scandals and tragedies that have beset Japan's national sport in recent years.\n\n\n\nAsashoryu, whose real name is Dolgorsuren Dagvadorj, grew up in Mongolia, where both his elder brothers and father were successful wrestlers.\n\n\n\nMoving to Japan as a student he was spotted and trained by the Takesago stable and made his professional debut at the age of 18 in 1999.\n\n\n\nWinning his first tournament, or basho, in 2002, his rise up the rankings culminated in him attaining the highest position of Grand Champion, or yokozuna, in January 2003, becoming only the 68th yokozuna in the sport's 2,000-year-old history.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, he set a new record by being the only man to win all six official tournaments in one year.\n\n\n\nWhile Asashoryu's meteoric rise to the top was seen by many as reinvigorating a sport that had seen a decline in homegrown wrestlers and popularity, his success in the dohyo has not pleased everyone.\n\n\n\nSome have complained that his wins are too routine, and purists grouse that he does not poses the quality of \"hinkaku,\" the dignity and calm expected in a yokozuna, or give the sport's traditions the necessary respect.\n\n\n\nIn 2003 he was disqualified from a bout for pulling on the top-knot of an opponent, and has gained a reputation as the enfant-terrible of sumo.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the criticisms of Asashoryu's wrestling style, sumo's reputation as a noble sport of tradition has suffered from a number of scandals in recent years and exposed it as just as susceptible to the problems faced by other sports.\n\n\n\nWith deep links to Japanese culture going back to when sumo was part of the Shinto religious rituals, the sport's troubles have almost represented a national identity crisis.\n\n\n\nFollowing the banning of three non-Japanese wrestlers for using recreational drugs in September, the sport's chairman and former-wrestler Kitanoumi resigned.\n\n\n\nIt came after a period of years in which a number of match-fixing allegations were made, some directly implicating Asashoryu, and plunging the sport into yet another crisis.\n\n\n\nIn January 2007 he was accused of bribing other wrestlers to lose bouts, compounding the view that corruption was prevalent in the sport.\n\n\n\nProblems for Asashoryu continued in 2007 when he was suspended by the sumo wrestling federation for allegedly faking a doctor's note and was restricted from leaving his house in Tokyo, leading to reports of a nervous breakdown.\n\n\n\nMental as well as physical strength are necessary to reach the top of the sport, but while the punishing physical routine and \"hazing\" in the training stables has been known and accepted, tragedy struck earlier this year.\n\n\n\nTakashi Saito, a 17-year-old sumo trainee, died in brutal circumstances, allegedly beaten to death by his stable-master and three fellow sumo wrestlers.\n\n\n\nContinuing to make his mark

Biti said.\n\n\n\nPostal ballots are usually requested for civil servants serving abroad, and the total number of soldiers and police in Zimbabwe add up to no more than 50,000, he said.\n\n\n\n\"Remember, when they stole this election away from us the last time, they stole it with 350,000 votes,\" Biti said. \"Six hundred thousand is double insurance. They cannot win a free and fair election in this country.\"\n\n\n\nThe elections are slated for Saturday.\n\n\n\nMugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging.\n\n\n\nThe president's other challenger this time is former Finance Minister Simba Makoni, who recently announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and was promptly booted out of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nLast week, New York-based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections, saying it was likely to be \"deeply flawed.\"\n\n\n\n\"As the elections near, all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice,\" the nongovernmental organization said in a 48-page report.\n\n\n\nThe elections are expected to provide Mugabe with the toughest challenge yet in his nearly 28 years of rule.\n\n\n\nThe report said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was partisan toward the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and had neither the expertise nor the resources to run the elections properly.

You can't judge the elections before they are held.\"\n\n\n\nNo matter the final outcome of the election, the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair. Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe, and there are no credible monitors in place.\n\n\n\nSince 1980, the 84-year-old Mugabe has been the country's only ruler.

The National Guardsmen were assigned to protect the civilian workers.\n\n\n\nThe Guardsmen and civilian contractors who worked there have described walking on and sitting near the bright orange powder that was widely dispersed throughout the grounds of the water plant.

One of the guardsmen may have died from the exposure, though the exact cause of his death earlier this year is still not clear.\n\n\n\nThe odorless sodium dichromate was used at the plant as an anti-corrosive, the lawsuit says. The chemical contained nearly pure hexavalent chromium, the toxic substance that poisoned homeowners in Hinkley, California, and was made famous by activist Erin Brockovich, according to the suit.\n\n\n\nFor the Guardsmen, KBR's \"knowing acts and omissions\" resulted in \"months and months of unprotected, unknowing, direct exposure to one of the most potent carcinogens and mutagenic substances known to man,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for KBR said the company was still reviewing the lawsuit, but denied responsibility for creating unsafe conditions at the plant.\n\n\n\n\"We are not providing comment on the suit at this time.

Harris won two awards.\n\nThe show went on without the self-proclaimed \"King of the South,\" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest.\n\nAuthorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, \"including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console.\"\n\nAt his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet.\n\n\"Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,\" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.\n\n\"The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns.\"\n\nThe sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement.\n\nThe bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said.\n\nThe guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said.\n\nHarris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said.\n\nCourt documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation.\n\n\"Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,\" according to an affidavit.", "qas": [{"question": "when was T.I arrested?", "id": "1272079830e045288cf3d0752a6fa3d7", "answers": [{"answer_start": 325, "text": "Saturday"}]}, {"question": "Where was T.I. arrested?", "id": "391a7fdd51944e06afa3c7fe338dea81", "answers": [{"answer_start": 241, "text": "midtown Atlanta."}]}, {"question": "Who won awards?", "id": "ed0bb059347f4fb38dcec73cb6fc8553", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1811, "text": "Harris"}]}, {"question": "When will the bond hearing take place?", "id": "5e983455b5be4ee788c28ee5b889972c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 123, "text": "Friday,"}]}, {"question": "What was the rapper T.I. arrested for on Saturday?", "id": "3af5fd79dfe743be9e29cec27572fe13", "answers": [{"answer_start": 54, "text": "gun charges,"}]}, {"question": "What weapons was T.I carrying?", "id": "9e0906b93e02441783d5b68582e59d81", "answers": [{"answer_start": 700, "text": "three machine guns"}]}, {"question": "what did TI do?", "id": "d571d248d30b4ecaba93f1eb28f88abd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 915, "text": "Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons,"}]}, {"question": "When was T.I. arrested", "id": "b3812b214fc04fad833518e375f34e58", "answers": [{"answer_start": 325, "text": "Saturday"}]}, {"question": "What is the rapper charged with?", "id": "a6a3831e65bd4a06aa984a16c845edd5", "answers": [{"answer_start": 54, "text": "gun charges,"}]}, {"question": "What is T.I. in custody for?", "id": "49e37f2ab89a42948fbd2249c10c2ddb", "answers": [{"answer_start": 54, "text": "gun charges,"}]}, {"question": "What did T.I. got arrested for", "id": "0d0a9395b6cb46db9f64e6acad197fd6", "answers": [{"answer_start": 54, "text": "gun charges,"}]}, {"question": "Who was arrested on weapons charges?", "id": "af1df0d16de14e6187d0a6906505ac65", "answers": [{"answer_start": 191, "text": "Clifford Harris,"}]}, {"question": "Did the rapper win any awards at the BET show?", "id": "13990b7394164f97b4c35cc400d63d5e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1811, "text": "Harris won two"}]}, {"question": "What is happening to T.I?", "id": "2cf921f1a4854045bd615640a37b2bad", "answers": [{"answer_start": 79, "text": "will remain in custody"}]}, {"question": "Who remains in custoday until Friday?", "id": "48cc49890e394c47ab4443d4f2e65e46", "answers": [{"answer_start": 166, "text": "T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris,"}]}, {"question": "When is T.I.s bond hearing scheduled for", "id": "3afe86583cc04c64ad908b3b2ae889e1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 123, "text": "Friday,"}]}, {"question": "when was arrested the raper?", "id": "ae2b7dd03781453d9e0ef25d421d808d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 325, "text": "Saturday"}]}, {"question": "When is the bond hearing?", "id": "9c46fbc04a814abc9146acfa990a1b4e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 123, "text": "Friday,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Almost all British troops", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Almost all British troops in Iraq are being pulled out because the agreement that allows them to be there expires on Friday, the British Ministry of Defence said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly all of Britain's troops in Iraq will have left by the week's end.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe withdrawal marks the first time since the invasion of Iraq more than six years ago that there will be almost no British troops in the country.

Last year, the Israeli air force tested its fighter jets and helicopters on a 870-mile sortie -- roughly the distance between Israel and Iran's main uranium enrichment plant at Natanz.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official line... Israel's security is a continuing concern. The common perception is that some, if not all of these exercises were a show of strength for Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates of when Iran could have a nuclear bomb differ widely.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, the Institute for Science and International Security released a report that concluded Iran does not have a nuclear weapon but does have enough low-enriched uranium for a single nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut an official at the International Atomic Energy Agency cautioned about drawing such conclusions. The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official said in February that Iran has not done so, and the agency's monitors and surveillance equipment at the Natanz facility would be able to detect any such activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDore Gold, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said, \"The IAEA has inspected the known nuclear sites of Iran. But it's believed they still have other clandestine nuclear sites where they may be enriching uranium or they may be pursuing a plutonium route like the North Koreans. So there's a certain amount of uncertainty in any assessment in the timeline of an Iranian bomb.\n\n\n\n\n\nIran says its nuclear ambitions are for peaceful means, and Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Israel's Defense Secretary Ehud Barak, at a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently, made it clear he believes U.S. attempts at negotiations with Iran have a shelf-life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We clearly believe that no option should be removed from the table and this is our policy. We recommend to others to take the same position, but we cannot dictate it to anyone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEfraim Kam, an Israeli analyst on Middle East affairs and author of \"From Terror to Nuclear Bombs: The Significance of the Iranian Threat,\" estimates that \"theoretically\" Iran could develop a nuclear bomb within the next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even if Israel's conviction is correct that Iran wants a nuclear weapon and it is close to achieving that desire, does that mean it would use it against Israel?\n\n\n\n\n\nKam said: \"My personal view is that Iran would not do it because they understand that Israel does have a nuclear arsenal.

Mike Huckabee on Tue", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts \"full responsibility\" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday.\n\n\n\nMaurice Clemmons, 37, was shot and killed early Tuesday by Seattle police. He was the subject of a two-day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began Sunday morning.\n\n\n\nClemmons had a criminal history in Arkansas and Washington. In May 2000, Huckabee commuted his 108-year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole, which was granted by the parole board two months later. Clemmons had been sentenced to 95 years, to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on the conservative news Web site Newsmax.com, Huckabee wrote that he commuted Clemmons' sentence from 108 years to 47 years. Reports that he had pardoned Clemmons or set him free were erroneous, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago,\" Huckabee said. \"I acted on the facts presented to me in 2000. If I could have possibly known what Clemmons would do nine years later, I obviously would have made a different decision. But if the same file was presented to me today, I would have likely made the same decision.\"\n\n\n\nBut the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at \"an astounding rate\" during his tenure as governor.\n\n\n\n\"He was exercising the clemency power at what I call a wholesale rate,\" Larry Jegley said. \"He was letting murderers out, he was letting rapists out, and he was letting the likes of Mr. Clemmons out.\"\n\n\n\nOne survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas.\n\n\n\nHe said he didn't know why so many clemencies were granted. \"That was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process. ... We never felt as though he gave victims, their families, jurors, law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community.\"\n\n\n\nHuckabee was a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another White House bid in 2012. During his 2008 campaign, he was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri.\n\n\n\n\"Between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10\u00bd years I was governor,\" Huckabee said Tuesday. \"Ninety-two percent of the time, I denied the requests.\"\n\n\n\nHe noted that in Arkansas, a governor does not initiate a sentence change -- the Post Prison Transfer Board makes a recommendation to the governor after reviewing an inmate's file. The governor then can grant or deny it.\n\n\n\nClemmons was 16 when he was charged with robbery and burglary. \"For the crimes he committed and the age at which he committed the crimes, [a 108-year sentence] was dramatically outside the norm for sentencing,\" Huckabee said. The board unanimously recommended that the sentence be commuted.\n\n\n\nJegley said that while in prison in Arkansas, Clemmons had a disciplinary record for violent incidents, and that something should have tipped off the board or the governor that \"this man was not a good candidate to be put back in society, because he couldn't live in the cloistered environment of prison and stay out of trouble.\"\n\n\n\nWatch what Jegley has to say\n\n\n\nIn the case of any form of clemency -- a commutation or a full pardon -- notice is given to the prosecutor, the judge, law enforcement officials, the attorney general and the secretary of state, as well as the media, for a public response period, Huckabee said. \"The only record of public response to the notice to commute was from the trial judge, who recommended the commendation in concert with the board.\"\n\n\n\nJegley ", "qas": [{"question": "What was man accused of?", "id": "c74ea36d83af4441be3167fda8bee5c6", "answers": [{"answer_start": 148, "text": "gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday."}]}, {"question": "When did Huckabee commute the sentence?", "id": "bb8c1477740b4bd18455b3055f5bb98a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 499, "text": "In May 2000,"}]}, {"question": "What percentage of requests were denied?", "id": "4eabcc0952174c2aa97df657e13776b1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2677, "text": "\"Ninety-two percent"}]}, {"question": "on what date the event occurred", "id": "85eb4e6d469f4dc3aa73c89a9f8c13e3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 502, "text": "May 2000,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natalie Cole's se", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation.\n\n\n\nNatalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nCole, who underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Tuesday, was \"responding well and recuperating\" Thursday, her publicist said.\n\n\n\nCole had been on what she called \"a very long list\" of people waiting for an organ donation when she got word recently that OneLegacy, an organ procurement agency in Southern California, had a kidney that was a biological match.\n\n\n\nIt was a \"directed donation\" from a deceased organ donor, according to OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone.\n\n\n\n\"Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match,\" Mone said.\n\n\n\nDirected organ donations are rare, and rarer still are those directed to someone not related to or known personally by the deceased, he said.\n\n\n\nThe donor will remain anonymous until the family gives permission for the name to be made public, he said.\n\n\n\nCole's need for a kidney donation was highly publicized, including with an appearance on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" on March 31.\n\n\n\n\"I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,\" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole.\n\n\n\nCole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C.

Hasan and Osama bin Laden have as much claim on Islam as do Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Persian poet Mawlana Jalal al-Din Rumi, who is the best-selling poet in America.

China regularly cracks down on its religious and ethnic minorities, keeps tight reins on the media and censors the Internet. Obama told the students that he is against censorship and is a believer in the free flow of information, calling it a \"source of strength\" in a democracy, despite the sting that sometimes comes with it.\n\n\n\nHe told the students he welcomes a strong China, saying there are very few global challenges -- specifically referring to climate change -- that can't be solved if the United States and China work together.\n\n\n\nThe town hall meeting was shown locally on Shanghai's Phoenix TV, but it was not broadcast nationally on any of China's state-run networks.

This is how he got his new name:\n\n\n\nI went to stay with my Uncle Jack in Miami Beach.\n\n\n\nI was so excited that I started knocking on doors the next day.\n\n\n\nI stopped at a small station on First Street, WAHR. The guy in charge liked my voice. \"We get a lot of people coming and going,\" he told me. \"If you hang around, you'll get the first opening.\"\n\n\n\nI sat and watched in fascination for a few weeks. It was a tiny operation, but the sight of the UPI and AP machines furiously clicking out news made me feel like I was on the brink of something big. Miami Beach was like a dream. The palm trees. The ocean. I remember walking past Joe's Stone Crab. Joe's is more than a restaurant, it's a landmark.\n\n\n\nIt was full when I arrived in 1957, and I guarantee you, people will be waiting in line tomorrow night. I stopped outside the front window with only a few dollars in my pocket, unable to afford a meal, looking at the happy faces, wondering what it would take to get into a place like that.\n\n\n\nThen came my big break. There was a morning deejay named Tom Baer. He was making sixty dollars a week and his alimony was sixty-five. He claimed to be living off the coconuts falling from trees. He quit on a Friday, and the general manager told me I could start on Monday.\n\n\n\nI must have rehearsed the entire weekend. I don't even think I slept. On Monday morning I showed up at WAHR with the record that would play my theme song, \"Swingin' Down the Lane.\"\n\n\n\nThe general manager called me into his office to wish me good luck. \"By the way,\" he said, \"what name are you going to use?\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\n\"You can't use Larry Zeiger,\" he said. \"It's too ethnic. People won't be able to spell it or remember it. You need a better name.\"\n\n\n\nThere was no time to think about whether this was good or bad or what my mother would say. I was going on the air in five minutes. The Miami Herald was spread out on his desk. Face-up was a full-page ad for King's Wholesale Liquors. The general manager looked down and said, \"King! How about Larry King?\"\n\n\n\n\"OK,\" I said. This was the opportunity of a lifetime. I wasn't going to blow it.\n\n\n\n\"Fine. You'll host The Larry King Show.\"\n\n\n\nNine o'clock was approaching. That's when the news came on. A few minutes later, The Larry King Show would make its debut. I went through the control-room door, sat down, and set up my record. The news ended. I started my theme song, then faded down the music so I could introduce myself. I opened my mouth. It was as dry as cotton. For the first time in my life, I couldn't speak.\n\n\n\nSo I brought \"Swingin' Down the Lane\" up again and faded it once more. Again, not a single word came out of my mouth.\n\n\n\nI could only wonder if listeners were hearing the pounding of my heart. I'd waited for this moment my whole life. How could I be blowing it?

So every day, I tiptoe through hormonally laced minefields hoping to avoid emotional carnage in response to any of my random comments or actions.\n\n\n\nThe cervical cancer vaccine, approved in 2006, is recommended for girls around 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAs I tiptoe, I sometimes stumble, as any mother of girls that age knows. No adult woman in her right mind would knowingly, willingly utter comments that result in young people hissing, hurling verbal grenades such as, \"Thanks, Mom, for calling me fat, AGAIN.\" Or \"Are you EVEN listening to me?\" Or any version of the very popular, \"I hate YOU,\" \"I hate you SO much,\" \"I hate this family,\" or just plain \"AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!\" followed by stomping feet and slamming doors.\n\n\n\nSo given this background, you might understand why, when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls, I was braced for a fight. Oddly enough, for once, the battle didn't come.\n\n\n\nI told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, sorry. You have to.\"\n\n\n\n\"I heard it hurts.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, that's too bad. But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh. (pause) OK.\"\n\n\n\nIf you were keeping score, you might chalk that one up as a Mom win.\n\n\n\nThe only problem with that is after winning over my daughter, I now had to convince myself. This drug has its own emotional battlefields.\n\n\n\nThe HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years. When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil, many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug. Dr. Kevin Ault, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University's School of Medicine, says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments, some not too serious, but others that are potentially deadly.\n\n\n\n\"There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus,\" he said. \"Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous, like plantar warts or warts on your hand. About 30 of them infect the genital tract, and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer.\"  Health for Her: Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn this case, the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer.\n\n\n\nThe National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008, there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives.\n\n\n\nGiven those stats, this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing, right?\n\n\n\nThe hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls, but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted. And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of \"to give or not to give.\"\n\n\n\nLet's face it. Parents don't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all. Ever. Now a new drug comes along, and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters, but it's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients.\n\n\n\nMerck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12.\n\n\n\nAult explains why youth is key. Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted, \"so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active, so they will not have been exposed ", "qas": [{"question": "what was approved for use", "id": "a78b494b73574ef89bc015078c11cafc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 233, "text": "cervical cancer vaccine,"}]}, {"question": "Who should get the vaccine?", "id": "c7c4dbc9ee8445f9b784291cd63d7f6e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 295, "text": "girls around 11 or 12."}]}, {"question": "What can cause cervical cancer", "id": "308fd3471884450dbcfc690ab8dc5398", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1047, "text": "HPV (human papillomavirus)"}]}]}]}, {"title": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Ten South Afri", "paragraphs": [{"context": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Ten South African ministers and the deputy president have resigned as President Thabo Mbeki prepares to leave office.\n\nSouth African President Thabo Mbeki announced his resignation in a televised address Sunday.\n\nHis replacement, African National Congress Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, will be sworn in as South Africa's president Thursday.\n\nMbeki announced he was resigning on Sunday, prompting threats from several Cabinet members to follow suit -- but the outgoing president urged them to stay in office, government sources said.\n\nThe resignations, which include Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, will take effect Thursday when Mbeki steps down, a government statement said.\n\n\"All the ministers have expressed their availability to assist the incoming administration in the hand-over process and any other assistance that might be sought from them,\" the statement said.\n\nThe finance minister's assistant told CNN that Manuel is willing to serve in the new government, if needed.\n\nThree deputy ministers have also tendered their resignations, a government statement said.\n\nA spokesman for South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, confirmed that it has named Motlanthe as its choice to succeed Mbeki. Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year, which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win.\n\nEarlier this month, the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption, fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki's political arch rival.

Judge Chris Nicholson made no ruling on Zuma's guilt or innocence, and he could be recharged.\n\nPolitical observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma's popularity, particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions.\n\nZuma has denied the charges.

I would be miserable if I didn't try again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA Rocky Road\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause both Klein and Arnold carry a single gene for their type of skeletal dysplasia, there is a chance they could both pass the gene on to their child, which could be lethal for their baby. To avoid this, embryos are genetically tested before implantation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on, the baby would be healthy and average sized; if one gene is passed, the baby would be a healthy little person.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Jen is on medication to stimulate her ovaries, which produced only half as many eggs as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking,\" says Arnold of sharing her difficult story with the world. \"That is comforting and is giving us strength. When we lost the pregnancy, we wondered how we were going to handle it.

He doesn't seem to mind.\n\n\n\n\"With the economy, I don't have enough cash to do cable, so I'm just really debating whether or not I really want to make that switch to digital,\" Richter said.\n\n\n\nRichter will have four months longer to make up his mind after Congress voted Wednesday to delay the end of TV's rabbit-ears era.\n\n\n\nOn June 12, analog TV signals will end and only digital signals will remain. Old televisions like Richter's won't accept the new form of broadcast.\n\n\n\nPeople with cable TV or satellite service will not be affected.\n\n\n\nThe switch had been scheduled for February 17, but Congress delayed the conversion -- which had been planned for years -- to accommodate people like Richter who had not been able to update their TVs.\n\n\n\nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration offered a program to help people buy converter boxes that make old TVs work in the new era. That giveaway didn't meet demand, though, and as of late January, more than 3.2 million people were on the program's waiting list.\n\n\n\nMore than 6.5 million U.S. households, or 5.7 percent, were not ready for the crossover last month, according to an estimate from the Nielsen Company.\n\n\n\nThere's been little made of the people behind those numbers, though, as media reports largely have focused on the mechanics of the switch and the politics of when and how it will happen. Many of those who haven't bought converters are poor, older than 55, rural residents or racial minorities, according to Nielsen's estimates. Some of them told CNN they couldn't afford to pay for cable or satellite TV service.\n\n\n\nWhile a person can live without TV, some of the late converts to digital depend on television for information and companionship.\n\n\n\n\"I live here by myself, so it will be a big deal for me,\" said Monica Lawson, a 42-year-old from rural Alto, Georgia. \"Even just a couple hours a day of having that extra interaction, it's a stress reliever for me.\"\n\n\n\nLawson said she got a coupon to buy the digital converter box for her analog television as soon as they became available. She's attached the box to her TV, but her signal got worse.\n\n\n\n\"Basically I'm downgrading at this point,\" she said. \"I'll go from having four or five channels I can watch on a regular basis to having one channel I can watch every now and then -- if at all.\"\n\n\n\nLawson, who is a real-estate appraiser and practices kinesiology, said she can't afford satellite service because her business has dropped with the economy.\n\n\n\nShe falls into a category of people who may lose their TV coverage with the switch to digital. It's likely the result of a phenomenon called the \"cliff effect.\" While analog signals fizzle out over long distances, digital signals tend to stop completely at a certain falling-off point.\n\n\n\n\"With digital, you get a great picture or nothing,\" said Mark Wigfield, spokesperson for the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n\n\nSome remote areas of the country could lose reception when analog signals stop in June, said Shermaze Ingram, spokesperson for the National Association of Broadcasters, an advocacy group that has been trying to inform people about the switch since 2006.\n\n\n\nOn the whole, studies show more people will get TV signals than will lose them in the switch to digital, Ingram said. The National Association of Broadcasters supports delaying the change until June in part because it will cause fewer people to go without TV after the change.\n\n\n\n\"There's no question that television is an important piece of the fabric ", "qas": [{"question": "Who can not afford to pay for cable?", "id": "bf138cf693f0444e960d28a85e72f955", "answers": [{"answer_start": 26, "text": "James Richter"}]}, {"question": "who delayed the switch?", "id": "734ca4956e434fc8b6712a684fcb7bdc", "answers": [{"answer_start": 993, "text": "Congress"}]}, {"question": "Who delayed a nationwide switch?", "id": "8fc9240c389d407db9a7410d11f3352e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 993, "text": "Congress"}]}, {"question": "What was delayed?", "id": "7e5d9591150248d8b366c339f50b3aad", "answers": [{"answer_start": 688, "text": "the end of TV's rabbit-ears era."}]}, {"question": "what is the switch?", "id": "44aa6bf4f6a74816940787187cfe1bac", "answers": [{"answer_start": 250, "text": "to digital."}]}]}]}, {"title": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed an exec", "paragraphs": [{"context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed an executive order granting some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees Wednesday, calling it \"a historic step\" but promising more action to come.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama has been criticized by gay rights activists for not doing more since taking office.\n\n\n\n\"We've got more work to do to ensure that government treats all its citizens equally, to fight injustice and intolerance in all its forms and to bring about that more perfect union,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nThe signing followed sharp criticism of the president over a Justice Department motion filed last week in support of the Defense of Marriage Act -- which effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions.

After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the \"border states\" to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke?\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do. And then there's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law. And that's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the federal government does take border enforcement seriously, critics might ask: Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally? Simple. We can dig a moat, deploy an army, build walls or call in an airstrike, but desperate people will always find a way to go around, under or over any impediment in their path to a better life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't to condone illegal immigration. My views -- in support of deportations, workplace raids, giving more resources to the Border Patrol etc. -- are well known. I'm just telling you what Border Patrol agents tell me: that it doesn't make any sense to focus all our attention ", "qas": [{"question": "Who says border has never been more protected?", "id": "0ec6bb1684c543b09f6617fe46af7f85", "answers": [{"answer_start": 457, "text": "Arizona Gov.

Bringing you today's commercial-free headlines, I'm Carl Azuz.\n\n\n\nFirst Up: Leaders Talk Climate Change\n\n\n\nAZUZ: First up, representatives from nearly 200 countries come together in New York to talk about global issues. This is called the United Nations General Assembly, and the decisions and resolutions that it makes set the agenda for a lot of what the U.N. works on throughout the year. One of the biggest focuses for this gathering is climate change. Secretary General Ban ki Moon calls it one of the most important issues of the 21st century. He's hoping that countries will work on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to climate change.\n\n\n\nDuring speeches yesterday, President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, who lead the countries that give off the most greenhouse gases, pledged to try to reduce them. Neither leader offered a specific timeframe for this, but both said they plan to cut greenhouse gases and increase the use of clean energy sources.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama also touched on another controversial issue yesterday: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Peace talks between the two groups have fizzled out recently, but Obama is urging both sides to come back to the negotiating table and work on a permanent solution. He met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday in an effort to restart discussions between these two.\n\n\n\nU.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Despite all the mistrust, we have to find a way forward. We have to summon the will to break the deadlock that has trapped generations of Israelis and Palestinians in an endless cycle of conflict and suffering.\n\n\n\nSpoken Word\n\n\n\nSONNY PERDUE, GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA: This has been a 48-hour ordeal that people had been, stayed here and to care for the safety of people. I just want to thank them. I want to thank those firefighters and first responders all across Georgia, from the east and Stevens county, to the west in Paulding and Carroll and Douglas, and in Cherokee in northwest Georgia. This has been a huge effort.\n\n\n\nSoutheast Flooding\n\n\n\nAZUZ: Okay, that was Georgia's Gov. Sonny Perdue there, talking about severe flooding that has led to at least eight deaths. Noting that nearly all of those were from drivers and passengers who were swept away by floodwaters, Gov. Perdue pleaded with residents to stay off the roads until the waters recede. Yesterday, he planned to ask President Obama to declare a federal emergency in order to free up money that would help with the relief efforts. With flash flood watches stretching across parts of the southeastern U.S., Rob Marciano examines the impact of this severe weather.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It's a cruel irony.

But there's a cool little day trip from Denver that often gets overlooked by out-of-towners.\n\n\n\nThe Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado.\n\n\n\nThe Ski Train is a 68-year-old local favorite that shuttles about 750 people between Denver and Winter Park. It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later.\n\n\n\nThe 56-mile trip takes about two hours each way, and many riders say it's worth the cost to avoid the traffic hassles of the oft-congested I-70.\n\n\n\nA roundtrip ticket costs between $49 and $85. There are additional expenses, such as parking at the train station in Denver and lift tickets for skiers. If someone chooses to shop instead of ski, a free shuttle into Winter Park is available.\n\n\n\nTrain riders love the trip route, which winds through the Rockies and climbs to 9,000 feet. It also travels through almost 30 tunnels, including the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which passes underneath the Continental Divide.\n\n\n\n\"The train ride up there is spectacular. You see wonderful vistas as you leave Denver through the northern plains and into the mountains,\" Kristal Kraft, a real estate agent in Denver, says. \"And once you get through the Moffat Tunnel, you're right there at Winter Park.\"\n\n\n\nKraft says she enjoyed her maiden voyage on the train, which came courtesy of a local home builder that bought group tickets in one of the club cars.\n\n\n\n\"I loved the convenience [of the train],' she says. \"We relaxed, talked, socialized. And when you get off the train, you are right there at the slopes.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to skitrain.com, three additional cars are available for charter and one for company retreats. The Web site lists the price for the presentation car at $5,000 for a winter trip. The site says the current train cars were purchased after Ansco Investment Company bought the Ski Train in 1988.\n\n\n\nKraft says the cars are comfortably heated and there is ample room to move around. Kraft, an amateur photography buff, enjoyed switching from window to window, side to side, to take pictures.\n\n\n\nThere is one occasional hitch to riding the train. It shares the track with the Union Pacific Railroad and at times has to stop or pullover to make way for a freight train or Amtrak. And there are instances where another train has an accident.\n\n\n\nOne time a coal train derailed in a tunnel and the Union Pacific officials told the Ski Train operators it would take two days to clear the tracks, says Ski Train media relations director Jim Bain.\n\n\n\nThey called the passengers together in a cafeteria in Winter Park and advised them to call friends and family to come pick them up. The company also arranged for a few buses to come gather the remaining passengers and Bain says they were all headed back to Denver by 8:30 p.m.\n\n\n\nIt was a worst-case scenario, he says, and it only happened once. There are occasional delays of a few hours.\n\n\n\nThe bad news is you're delayed; the good news is you're on a full service train with food service and restrooms. And there's the ability to find a beverage.\n\n\n\nOne reviewer on the Web site yelp.com said there's another bonus to the train.\n\n\n\n\"What's great is that once you get back into Denver you can hit Wynkoop brewery or any other bars around there to keep the party rolling,\" Ramon G. wrote.", "qas": [{"question": "what has been a local favorite for 68 years?", "id": "11682b8601734e57bd4ba82eb9f20e77", "answers": [{"answer_start": 286, "text": "The Ski Train"}]}, {"question": "where does the train travel from?", "id": "e8c205f129ea4cff9a5204db9b89ddf2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 265, "text": "Denver, Colorado."}]}, {"question": "where does the train pass through", "id": "cc143e8060be487db153d91159e40e82", "answers": [{"answer_start": 963, "text": "the Rockies"}]}, {"question": "where does the train take skiers to", "id": "8adf6db963574dad935d7158c4c5d364", "answers": [{"answer_start": 363, "text": "between Denver and Winter Park."}]}, {"question": "what do residents say about the train ride", "id": "d67b0638b8c943c596db2bb2795e4edb", "answers": [{"answer_start": 915, "text": "riders love the trip route, which winds through the Rockies and climbs to 9,000 feet."}]}, {"question": "what is the name of the tunnel underneath the Continental Divide?", "id": "d72a1897a39b4a289c85a26e68a970b2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1067, "text": "Moffat"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has iden", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country's assistant interior minister last Thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack.\n\n\n\nA Saudi man reads a newspaper featuring a front-page story on Thursday's attack.\n\n\n\nThe disclosures reported by the country's official news agency were highly unusual.\n\n\n\nThe agency, SPA, reported the attacker, Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri, a wanted Saudi militant who had been hiding in Yemen, got in touch with Saudi authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Naif, the assistant minister of Interior for Security Affairs.\n\n\n\nAfter arriving back in Saudi Arabia, Asiri spoke by phone to Mohammed, who agreed to see him during a Ramadan reception at his home in the city of Jeddah.\n\n\n\nAccording to a transcript provided by SPA, during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n\n\nMohammed is quoted as telling Asiri that \"one should be careful; evil people would like to exploit all of you. Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home.\" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed.\n\n\n\nAsiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince.\n\n\n\nAccording to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported.\n\n\n\nMohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack.\n\n\n\nSaudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake.\n\n\n\nSPA adds that \"the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time.\"\n\n\n\nAsiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them.\n\n\n\nSome of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\"\n\n\n\nAl Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested.\n\n\n\nWhile the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an \"action of treachery and treason\", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its \"open-door policy\" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, \"those citizens residing outside the country\" who wish to \"take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Where has the Saudi militant been hiding?", "id": "d406698c75a144f88c496b4e90f26ca7", "answers": [{"answer_start": 535, "text": "in Yemen,"}]}, {"question": "Who is wanted?", "id": "f06f7d84a78f412282d3bc847fcca401", "answers": [{"answer_start": 461, "text": "Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri,"}]}, {"question": "W\\Who did Asiri meet with?", "id": "b3a6721fd03c4610b1485c6b394d885a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 626, "text": "Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Naif, the assistant minister of Interior for Security Affairs."}]}, {"question": "Where had Asiri been hiding?", "id": "2192ae48715343f7b729bfebfe062bed", "answers": [{"answer_start": 538, "text": "Yemen,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Nancy Reagan, wife of the late President ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Nancy Reagan, wife of the late President Ronald Reagan, is hospitalized in California after suffering a broken pelvis, according to spokeswoman Joanne Drake.\n\n\n\nFormer first lady Nancy Reagan is shown at an event in the nation's capital in September.\n\n\n\nReagan, 87, is in the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Drake said in a written statement Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe former first lady fell last week at her home, Drake said, but admitted herself to the hospital only after experiencing \"persistent pain.\" Tests revealed a fractured pelvis and sacrum -- the triangular bone within the pelvis.\n\n\n\nReagan will remain hospitalized for a few days until \"doctors are satisfied with her progress,\" Drake said.

Page Museum.\n\nZed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles. An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth's skull, according to project director Christopher Shaw.\n\n\"The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper,\" Shaw told CNN Thursday. \"We don't know just how smashed up it is, but it's fairly intact because it's a huge jacket we put it around.\"\n\nThe mammoth's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"tree-boxed\" along with the surrounding dirt, creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact. Zed's remains were encased in a plaster jacket.\n\nThe construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones.\n\nConstruction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum, who began analyzing the various fossils in June, Shaw said.\n\n\"It's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years,\" Shaw said.\n\nJohn Harris, the head curator of the Page Museum, publicly announced the finding of \"a whole new treasure trove of fossils\" on Wednesday.

Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years.\n\nNot all of Zed's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed.\n\n\"Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated, including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis, one tusk and the lower jaw,\" Shaw said. \"It will take another six to 12 months to open everything.\"\n\nShaw said both of Zed's tusks were found intact, which is very rare.\n\n\"Previously, we've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved,\" Shaw said. \"It's very exciting to us to have these two complete, beautifully preserved tusks.\"\n\nThe excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum's attendance and funding, which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession.\n\n\"The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the 'fishbowl' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned,\" Shaw said. \"So people come to see us and we've constructed small exhibits.

And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten.

Over the years, ratings for the show gradually declined, but the formula was revived in early 2008 with the first season of \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\n\n\nThe tasks, pressure-cooker atmosphere and boardroom bickering stayed the same, but the competition now featured contestants with varying degrees of fame and focused on raising money for charity.\n\n\n\nThe first \"Celebrity Apprentice\" top spot went to Piers Morgan, the prickly judge on \"Britain's Got Talent\" who made news this spring when he invited singing sensation Susan Boyle to dinner after her memorable performance on the show.\n\n\n\nMorgan also made several appearances on this season's \"Apprentice,\" sitting in as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" during one episode and interviewing the final four candidates in another.\n\n\n\nMorgan's aggressive questioning seemed to annoy the celebrities, especially Jesse James, who glared icily at Morgan when he kept asking him why he did not turn to his wife, Sandra Bullock, for help in raising money during the various tasks.\n\n\n\nPerhaps Bullock might be tempted to try competing ", "qas": [{"question": "Who will she play in the final?", "id": "9508601ca2724c259442daa574ec6e2f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 541, "text": "Annie Duke"}]}, {"question": "Who has won this season?", "id": "947f12b8aa8c4209a1472f10f2424a90", "answers": [{"answer_start": 190, "text": "Joan Rivers"}]}, {"question": "Who won this season's Celebrity Apprentice?", "id": "682c7b2e730244809d631539f9bf69da", "answers": [{"answer_start": 141, "text": "Joan Rivers'"}]}, {"question": "What does the victory mean for the charity?", "id": "be16a44a8c3f4e229442e38c9701ef74", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1340, "text": "$250,000"}]}, {"question": "How much does the Charity get?", "id": "455c1d1b4207431f8ff8db6ca4989d2a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1340, "text": "$250,000"}]}, {"question": "What does the victory mean?", "id": "eec978f73e724203b8b4974255dcfa4e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1340, "text": "$250,000 for Rivers' charity: God's Love We Deliver."}]}, {"question": "Who wins this season's \"Celebrity Apprentice\"?", "id": "8efa4e3802454905a846335425e82876", "answers": [{"answer_start": 141, "text": "Joan Rivers'"}]}, {"question": "Who goes up against poker champion Annie Duke in finale?", "id": "5190259794744c2bb57eb2ec83a7044b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 190, "text": "Joan Rivers"}]}, {"question": "Who attracts more celebrities?", "id": "059ba875878347a6a578f79b78f09c28", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1092, "text": "Rivers"}]}]}]}, {"title": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The last survivor of the ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The last survivor of the Titanic, 97-year-old Millvina Dean, is auctioning off her remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills.\n\n\n\nMillvina Dean, 97, is trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers.\n\n\n\nThe auction, which is expected to raise up to $50,000 for her, is set to take place Saturday near her home in England.\n\n\n\nIt is the second auction in less than a year for Dean, who was a 9-week-old when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.\n\n\n\nAmong the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, said Alan Aldridge of the auction house.\n\n\n\n\"Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia, the rescue ship, in a mail sack,\" Aldridge said.

Others are expected to be seen in coming decades.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss.\n\nFor those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nHere are Henson's top five choices:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\n\nWarming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays.\n\nMany of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades.\n\nHenson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed.\n\n\"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\"\n\nBoats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nHow much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic.\n\n\"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said.\n\nBut for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term.\n\n\"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said.\n\nHenson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent.\n\n\"It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,\" he said. \"You're standing below the level of the river, looking up.\"\n\nRocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado\n\nHerds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees.\n\nCold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles. But winters are warming, and Henson and others said they worry the beetles can't be stopped.\n\nThe beetle infestation \"has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues,\" said Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nThe beetles are causing problems all over America's mountainous west, but the issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver. Henson recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape. Some of the reddened forests look beautiful in a strange way, Henson said, but visitors should note ", "qas": [{"question": "What may do what?", "id": "87b53cb7f58349ef9de6f8a1033699c4", "answers": [{"answer_start": 102, "text": "Glaciers in the European Alps"}]}, {"question": "will the glaciers melt", "id": "d3d3a6d45102452993e2ad22b6e261d3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 132, "text": "may"}]}, {"question": "What bugs are ruining the forest?", "id": "a24064f15c0c4365a7358f2816906914", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3043, "text": "pine beetles"}]}, {"question": "What is happening in Colorado?", "id": "05c9c5f852f14a30ad866b3d517b6091", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3029, "text": "Herds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at"}]}, {"question": "When will the glaciers melt?", "id": "5e12a545101d40f58842b623e28df786", "answers": [{"answer_start": 141, "text": "as soon as 2050,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Ameneh Bahrami is certain th", "paragraphs": [{"context": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Ameneh Bahrami is certain that one day she'll meet someone, fall in love and get married.

As she walked to the bus stop, she remembers sensing someone behind her.\n\n\n\nShe turned around and was startled to see Movahedi. A moment later came the agonizing pain. Movahedi had thrown something over her. What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin.\n\n\n\n\"I was just yelling, 'I'm burning! I'm burning! For God's sake, somebody help me!' \"\n\n\n\nThe acid seeped into Bahrami's eyes and streamed down her face and into her mouth. When she covered her face with her hands, streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms.  Watch how the still-pungent acid destroyed Bahrami's clothes \u00bb\n\n\n\nTwo weeks after the attack, Movahedi turned himself in to police and confessed in court. He was convicted in 2005 and has been behind bars all along.\n\n\n\nBahrami's lawyer, Ali Sarrafi, said Movahedi had never shown any remorse. \"He says he did it because he loved her,\" Sarrafi said.\n\n\n\nAttack victims in Iran usually accept \"blood money\": a fine in lieu of harsh punishment. With no insurance and mounting medical bills, Bahrami could've used the cash, but she said no.\n\n\n\n\"I told the judge I want an eye for an eye,\" Bahrami said. \"People like him should be made to feel my suffering.\"  Watch how the acid destroyed Bahrami's eyes (includes graphic content) \u00bb\n\n\n\nBahrami's demand has outraged some human rights activists. Criticizing acid-attack victims is almost unheard of, but some Internet bloggers have condemned Bahrami's decision.\n\n\n\n\"We cannot condone such cruel punishment,\" wrote one blogger. \"To willingly inflict the same treatment on a person under court order is a violation of human rights.\"\n\n\n\nLate last year, an Iranian court gave Bahrami what she asked for. It sentenced Movahedi to be blinded with drops of acid in each eye. This month, the courts rejected Movahedi's appeal.\n\n\n\nBahrami's lawyer, Sarrafi, said the sentencing might be carried out in a matter of weeks. He said he doesn't think Bahrami will change her mind.

The fact is, Miami is no longer the same city as the one portrayed in the 1980s cop show.\n\n\n\nParty time in Little Havana.\n\n\n\nThe expansive sandy beaches are still there, as is the surfeit of sunshine, the hint of the exotic and the hordes of sun-hungry tourists who have flocked to this holiday hotspot for the last 80 years. But Miami has shed much of its unwanted baggage from the 80s and has grown beyond a resort town into something more substantial.\n\n\n\nStill barely 100 years old, Miami was a tourist destination almost from its inception. The offshore sandbar called Miami Beach was quickly recognized as having all the ingredients of a world-class holiday resort and the hotel-building spree that took place in the 1920s and 30s has left Miami Beach with hundreds of stunning Art Deco structures that give the area its distinctive look\n\n\n\nBy the 1980s, as well as being the destination of choice for holiday makers, retirees and 'snowbirds' (Canadians and northern Americans wintering in Florida), Miami had attracted an uninvited guest -- the 'cocaine cowboy.' Miami's proximity to South America made it a key point of entry for Colombian cocaine smugglers and the city became a battleground for ruthless drug barons intent on grabbing their piece of the American Dream.\n\n\n\nThe mid 80s was the Miami Vice era, when the city's reputation for glamour and hedonism came with a side order of carjackings and gangland shootouts. But by the mid 90s, Miami had largely driven the cocaine cowboys out of town and hoteliers like Ian Schrager began converting some of those Art Deco classics into sophisticated boutique hotels fit for the international jet set. The guns may have gone but the glitz was never far away.\n\n\n\nNow that Miami's been to rehab and come out cleaned up and healthy, it turns out there's more to the city than glitzy nightclubs and the surgically enhanced bodies of the beautiful people. Miami has acquired a reputation as the new kid on the block in the modern art scene, a reputation that was cemented when the world's most prestigious modern art fair, Art Basel, arrived in the city in 2002.\n\n\n\nJust like the snowbirds, Art Basel returns to Miami each winter and the Wynwood neighborhood has now become a bona fide art district, with exclusive galleries showcasing cutting-edge art all year round. Nearby, the Design District is full of studios and workshops producing contemporary furniture and art.\n\n\n\nThen there's the fact that Miami is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, with some 60% of the population born outside the U.S. The food, music, culture and language of Latin America have all become part of modern Miami, giving the city a cultural heritage that belies its youth.\n\n\n\nBut don't think Miami's reinvention as a cultural destination has done anything to dent it's appetite for the good times. When it comes to partying, there's not many places that can keep up with Miami, and even fewer that can do it with as much style.

We saw pundits, columnists, journalists, radio talk show hosts, psychologists, body language experts, entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger: Was he really sorry for committing adultery, should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans. I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize, yet couldn't articulate why it mattered so much to her, especially since she wasn't his wife, kin to him, and wasn't a family friend.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete, it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs, he has broken no laws, and what he did doesn't affect us at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet Williams is another matter. This week, he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14, 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome carried his sentencing live. Yet most networks ignored his case, which ended eight years of courtroom drama.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrankly, if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes, it's Jayson, not Tiger.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court. After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career, he was a rising TV analyst with NBC, a playful man with a big heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll never forget watching him on \"Oprah\" with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion, how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended. After a dinner, Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut. Williams didn't realize it was loaded, and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest.\n\n\n\n\n\nA panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi's hand, and even jumped in his pool, hoping to wash away the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup. He settled with Christofi's family for $2 million, all while the case went back and forth through the legal system.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile that was happening, Williams began to lose it all. His wife filed for divorce; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns, a deadly combination.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was sentenced to five years in jail and is eligible for parole in 18 months. Everything he had -- money, fame, budding TV career, marriage, friends, respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night.\n\n\n\n\n\nJayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's. The former killed a man, the latter cheated on his wife. Both morally wrong, only one legally wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger will undoubtedly return to the golf course one day. Sure, he can fret about losing millions in endorsements and may have to confront losing his wife. But Williams must forever live with the memory of a man dying as a result of his actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all may want to focus on Tiger, but it's the tragedy of Jayson Williams that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S.

from a moral standpoint as well as from a professional standpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Goldstone Report is a distorted, false, and irresponsible report,\" Barak said. \"All of the soldiers and officers whom we sent to battle need to know that the state of Israel stands behind them even on the day after.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Gaza Operation Investigations: An Update\" -- a follow-up of a July paper on the Gaza mission -- is in response to the United Nations' call for both the Jewish state and the Palestinian Hamas movement to conduct independent inquiries to examine charges that both sides committed war crimes during the course of the Gaza war fought just over a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's 46-page response outlines the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of its three-week offensive -- dubbed Operation Cast Lead -- in Gaza aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael says it faced \"asymmetric conflicts\" and blamed \"militants operating from within and behind civilian areas\" for placing civilians at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military has \"launched investigations into 150 separate incidents, including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far,\" according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Israel is committed to ensuring that every such incident is fully and fairly investigated, to ensure that lessons can be learned and that, if justified, criminal or disciplinary proceedings initiated,\" the report stated. \"To this end the IDF policy requires that every allegation of wrongdoing be investigated, irrespective of its source.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report does not mention whether Israel will conduct an independent, non-military investigation of the charges of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity leveled in the Goldstone Report.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased in September, the 575-page report written by a commission chaired by South African Judge Richard Goldstone alleged that both Hamas and Israel committed war crimes and may have also committed crimes against humanity during the course of fighting that killed some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of criticism in the report was reserved for Israel which has waged an aggressive international public relations campaign to discredit the probe's findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the publication of the report, the United Nations asked both Israel and Hamas to initiate independent investigations into the the various allegations and report back before February 5 when the General Assembly will be taking up the report and its recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those recommendations were the call for the report's findings to be passed on to the International Criminal Court if both sides did not start legitimate investigations into war crimes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Israel, the military has conducted investigations into possible wrong-doing itself which has raised criticism from human rights groups and some Israeli lawmakers that a more credible investigation is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's outgoing attorney-general Menachem Mazuz told the Haaretz newspaper Friday \"Israel has a clear interest in conducting a serious, expert examination that will deal with the (Goldstone) report and produce an opposing report.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Gaza, the ruling Hamas movement this week released a 20-page summary of the steps it has taken to investigate wrong-doing, contending it had prevented militants from rocketing Israeli civilians and that any examples to the contrary were a result of mistaken fire.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a claim quickly dismissed by the by human rights organizations and the Israeli government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence, but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located,\" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch said in a statement. \"Hamas leaders at the time indicated they were intending to harm civilians.\"", "qas": [{"question": "Who did the U.N. accuse of actions amounting to war crimes?", "id": "48b0344f035e40e793cb0fdf88ae94e1", "answers":

Not even for Hunni, a horse that has won trophies and ribbons in national riding competitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm willing to take almost any offer,\" Bonfanti said. \"I know my trainer would say I'm crazy. 'You can't give that horse away. She is valuable.' \"\n\n\n\n\n\nBonfanti even considered the county animal shelter as a possible solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had contacted a few people,\" she said. \"And the factor that there is the possibility that a horse could be put down made me look further.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the Los Angeles County shelter took in 188 abandoned or abused horses -- up 600 percent from the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nVeterinarian David Byerly says the numbers are even worse this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It has not leveled off in any way,\" Byerly said. \"It just keeps going up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nByerly says that for the first time, the county has had to euthanize abandoned horses because its facilities are full.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorses considered likely adoption candidates are spared. Even so, the Los Angeles County animal shelter is killing abandoned horses at a rate of three or four a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is not a fate that James Gulledge wants for his horse, Rico.\n\n\n\n\n\nGulledge says he first met Rico at the Lifesavers shelter. \"I was volunteering over there and just fell in love with him,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now the economy is forcing some hard choices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm very conflicted about it,\" Gulledge said. \"It's just a decision about paying for him or having some money to help some important people make it through all this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGulledge chose to return Rico to Lifesavers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Starr, the horse is one more mouth to feed, and she intends to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm hoping that this is the worst of this, that we are going to climb out of this pretty soon,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, she said, \"I will take care of them and won't let anything bad happen to them. ...

did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\n\n\nThe fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times, according to the FDA's Dr. Renata Albrecht.\n\n\n\n\"This risk is further increased in those over age 60, in kidney, heart, and lung transplant recipients, and with use of concomitant steroid therapy,\" the FDA said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAlbrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon.\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes it's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning,\" she

Ralph Nader, said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007.\n\n\n\n\"Because

(Warner Brothers, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.)\n\n\n\nThe typically flamboyant plot of \"Chandni Chowk\" was loosely inspired by Kumar's own life. Born in Punjab but raised in Delhi, he came to acting late after working as a waiter in Bangkok. While in the Thai capital he learned martial arts, which he taught upon his return to India before becoming a male model.\n\n\n\nHe landed his first movie role in the 1992 Hindi language film \"Deeder\" and has gone on to become one of Bollywood's leading men. He is married to fellow actor Twinkle Khanna.

Patty Murray, D-Washington, took to the Senate floor Thursday, urging more help for military members, especially for those returning from war.\n\n\n\n\"Our brave service members who face deployment after deployment without the rest, recovery and treatment they need are at the breaking point,\" Murray said.\n\n\n\nShe said Congress has given \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to the military to improve its ability to provide mental health treatment, but said it will take more than money to resolve the problem.\n\n\n\n\"It takes leadership and it takes a change in the culture of war,\" she said. She said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help.\n\n\n\n\"Many soldiers need a real person to talk to,\" she said. \"And they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to Army statistics, the incidence of U.S. Army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the Iraq war.\n\n\n\nLast year's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002, the year before the war in Iraq began, according to the Army.\n\n\n\nThe figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in March, Army officials said.\n\n\n\nThe Army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides. Suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths, compared with 87 in 2005.\n\n\n\nCameron-Ritchie, the Army psychiatrist, said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships, but they are also related to problems with work, finances and the law.\n\n\n\n\"The really tough area here is stigma. We know that soldiers don't want to go seek care. They're tough, they're strong, they don't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider,\" Cameron-Ritchie said.\n\n\n\nMultiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships, thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts, she said.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age- and gender-matched civilians. But in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006, she said. That's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000, she said.\n\n\n\nThe \"typical\" soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act, according to the Army.\n\n\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts, Cameron-Ritchie said, because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\n\"The real central issue is relationships. Relationships, relationships, relationships,\" said U.S. Army Chaplain Lt. Col. Ran Dolinger. \"People look at PTSD, they look at length of deployments ... but it's that broken relationship that really makes the difference.\"\n\n\n\nTo reduce suicides, the Army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been ", "qas": [{"question": "What is the senator doing about it?", "id": "2624dd60e3e94efca3172a09af392342", "answers": [{"answer_start": 552, "text": "introduce legislation Thursday to improve the military's suicide-prevention programs."}]}, {"question": "What is the Psychiatrist name?", "id": "cb87b0e309514c2a9999aa0b3884248e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 416, "text": "Col.

But they came to the United States with 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca. They divorced in January 2009 after Christopher Savoie was unfaithful.

But this is how Eva Schloss remembers her childhood friend Anne Frank, who had she not died in a Nazi concentration camp, would have celebrated her 80th birthday this week.\n\n\n\nSchloss described Frank, whose account of hiding from Jewish persecution in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam is one of the world's mostly widely-read books, as a spunky young schoolgirl with a passion for storytelling that often got her into trouble.\n\n\n\n\"She got her diary in 1942, so obviously her father knew she was interested in writing and I know she told stories,\" said Schloss.\n\n\n\n\"She talked a lot and she was called Mrs Quack Quack. Very often she used to write hundreds of lines [at school] of 'I'm not going to talk so much,' and so on -- but obviously she had a lot to tell.\"\n\n\n\nIn some ways the two friends lived parallel lives -- but tragically they had very different outcomes.  Watch more about Schloss' story \u00bb\n\n\n\nSchloss and Frank both came from Jewish families who fled to Holland to escape the wave of anti-Semitism spreading across Europe as the Nazis rose to power in Germany ahead of the Second World War.\n\n\n\nBut while Schloss was more of an introvert, Frank loved the limelight. Schloss said: \"I was actually quite shy and she was the center of attention. We had steps where we sat, and she had a crowd of children around her.\n\n\n\n\"She was a big flirt -- she loved boys. She was always showing us who was her boyfriend at that particular time. She was always interested in her clothes. Her style, she always changed it. Sometimes she had curls, then she had straight hair.\"\n\n\n\nSchloss says they were unaware of the full scale of what was going on around them as war escalated across Europe, placing their lives in increasing jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\"Our parents really protected us so there was no talk about the horrendous things which happened.\n\n\n\n\"You couldn't go out anymore after 8 o'clock, but for a 11 to 12 year old it didn't matter so much. Or not going to the cinema -- we were upset about those little things which we couldn't do, but we really didn't really take it seriously at that time.\"\n\n\n\nLike Frank, Schloss was also forced into hiding when the Nazis took control of Holland.\n\n\n\nFrank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office. But Schloss and her family had to split up. Schloss stayed with her mother while her father and brother hid elsewhere. She and her mother moved around, staying in seven different hiding places over a two-year period.\n\n\n\nEventually both families were betrayed and were sent to concentration camps, where Frank died at the age of 15.\n\n\n\nSchloss said: \"My father and brother were betrayed by a Dutch nurse who was a double agent, and all four of us were arrested and taken to the headquarters to be interrogated.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't know anything, which was a good thing. So eventually they realized this and they gave up torturing me. Within two days we were put on a transport to Auschwitz.\"\n\n\n\nOf her family, only Schloss and her mother survived Auschwitz, one of the most notorious concentration camps, located in southern Poland.\n\n\n\nToday Schloss, who has just celebrated her own 80th birthday, has a husband, three daughters and five grandchildren.\n\n\n\nSchloss says it took her decades to rebuild her life, with the help of Frank's father Otto, who also survived incarceration in a concentration camp.\n\n\n\nShe met Otto in August 1945, when he showed her Frank's diary.\n\n\n\nSchloss said: \"He read a few passages but he always burst into tears.

In short, there's nothing to worry about with an airline like American, but I thought it would be a good idea to devote this week's column to the issue since it's at the top of mind for many travelers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill American go bankrupt? I'm certainly not qualified to answer that question. Only the airline itself knows its plans, but the balance sheet certainly doesn't point to bankruptcy being necessary in the short to medium term.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, American has been losing money recently while others have profited, but at the end of June, it had more than $5 billion in the bank and it has been able to arrange financing since then. That doesn't sound like a company that would be filing for bankruptcy protection, which should be a last resort. Even if it does for some strategic reason, flights wouldn't be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it's worth talking about what to do when an airline goes bankrupt, because airlines around the world shut down every year. It's always good to know what you can do. Here is some advice.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways pay with a credit card\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you buy a ticket, you might be paying for something (a flight, presumably) that you won't use for another year. That's a long time for an airline to hold on to your money, and that's why you should pay with a credit card.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you buy a ticket with a credit card, then you won't be on the hook if your airline goes under. In fact, when airlines start to find themselves in financial trouble, credit card processors hold back a larger and larger percentage of the money until the flight occurs. That way, if the airline doesn't perform, the credit card company still has your money and can give it right back to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriodically check in on your airline\n\n\n\n\n\nIt sounds silly when you're talking about an airline like American, because you would know instantly if it filed for bankruptcy protection. But what if you bought a ticket on Kuwait-based Wataniya Airways? Would you even know that it shut down in March of this year? Probably not.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if you do find yourself booked on an airline that might not be very well known here in the U.S., it can't hurt to check in every so often to make sure it's still flying. Most airlines with websites are very good at letting you know when they go out of business.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven better, you can set up an alert via Google that will send you a note anytime an airline's name pops up in the news. This is hardly necessary for the better-known airlines around the world, of course, but it's a good idea for smaller airlines that you want to keep an eye on.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a backup plan\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're worried about an airline going out of business for one reason or another, have a mental backup plan waiting in case you need to spring into action. Find out what other airlines fly where you need to go, and be ready to try to pounce if something happens. If you're prepared, you'll be able to get that last seat on your alternate before someone else who was unprepared even knows what's happening. But you'll still have to pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't expect help from other airlines\n\n\n\n\n\nThere used to be a rule in the U.S. that other airlines had to honor tickets on failed airlines for a nominal fee. That doesn't exist anymore, so don't go looking for charity from other airlines if yours goes under. Elsewhere in the world, there can be varying levels of assistance, but it's best to just assume that ", "qas": [{"question": "what fears swirl around American Airlines?", "id": "a0316e8dbe4c496a8dd5d3addc96fbae", "answers": [{"answer_start": 63, "text": "bankruptcies"}]}, {"question": "what is american airlines", "id": "9f5ec1c574c842cfa194293fecf7ab43", "answers": [{"answer_start": 152, "text": "carrier based in Texas."}]}]}]}, {"title": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father wants a judge to order the pop star's estate to pay him a monthly allowance, according to papers filed in court Friday.\n\n\n\nJoe Jackson, the 80-year-old Jackson family patriarch, was not named in Michael Jackson's 2002 will, which left his wealth to his mother, Katherine Jackson, his three children and undisclosed charities.\n\n\n\nBrian Oxman, Joe Jackson's lawyer, filed the petition Friday asking for him to be included in the family allowance.\n\n\n\nThe matter will be considered Tuesday when Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff convenes the next hearing on matters related to the probate of Jackson's will, Oxman said.\n\n\n\nThe filing does not publicly specify how much Jackson's father is requesting.\n\n\n\nHoward Weitzman, one of the lawyers for the estate's special administrators, said Joe Jackson's request \"will be considered as are all requests for money from Michael's estate.\"\n\n\n\n\"It was quite surprising to learn of the request,\" Weitzman said.\n\n\n\nMichael Jackson's mother and his three children receive a court-ordered allowance from the estate totaling more than $86,000 a month, according to court documents.

A lawyer from Chile, he was educated there, in Spain and at Harvard Law School.\n\nJos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights.\n\n(CNN) -- Peruvians are celebrating an extraordinary victory this week: the conviction of their former president, Alberto Fujimori, for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s.\n\nThe Peruvian Supreme Court found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses, including the massacre of innocent civilians, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful.\n\nIt is one of the first times a nation's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations. Equally significant, the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial, which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law.\n\nFujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but, in the process of restoring order, he corrupted and weakened Peru's most vital government institutions -- including parliament, the courts and law enforcement. Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary.\n\nFor a decade, his government used bribery, extortion, and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency, subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary, legislature, and media on government abuses.\n\nHe led Peru from 1990 to 2000, presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads. Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges.\n\nThe landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state. Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book. In the late 20th century, Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Milton Obote, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko, to name just a few, were never brought to trial.\n\nSince then, however, the tide has turned. In October 1998, London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes. The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere, but more important, they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice.\n\nIn country after country, particularly in Latin America, victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power. Thanks to these efforts, former leaders in Argentina, and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials.\n\nPinochet's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda, and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished.\n\nAfter the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.\n\nThe ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur.\n\nThe Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president.\n\nA second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori.

Ferguson is Senior Lecturer in Education and Public Policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard Kennedy School. His most recent book is \"Toward Excellence with Equity: An emerging vision for closing the achievement gap,\" published by Harvard Education Press. He is the creator of the Tripod Project for School Improvement and also the faculty co-chair and director of the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University.\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald Ferguson says parents can play a key role in improving their children's education.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Raising the quality of teaching and learning in American schools is a priority. It receives a great deal of attention in our national discourse and should receive more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest scores and graduation rates are improving faster in other nations than in the United States and this threatens our quality of life in a competitive world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, achievement gaps between racial groups in the United States remain large. The social and political vitality of the nation may depend on closing these racial gaps. Blacks and Hispanics are doing better than in the past compared to whites, but still not nearly good enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking schools better should be only one part of our national strategy. Life at home has been a relatively neglected topic and needs to come out of the shadows.\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially in churches, neighborhood organizations, families and informal social networks, helping parents do their best needs to be as big a priority as achieving excellent schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goes beyond public policies. I am talking about changes in mindsets and lifestyles in a national social and cultural movement to close achievement gaps between groups -- a movement to achieve excellence with equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore reading at home is a place to start. I present data in my recent book based on a large sample of students in elementary and secondary schools from several states.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack and Hispanic students reported less leisure reading at home compared to whites, watched television more, were much more likely to have televisions in their bedrooms and (perhaps as a consequence) were more prone to become sleepy at school. Also, blacks and Hispanics, including those with college-educated parents, reported fewer books in their homes than whites whose parents had fewer years of schooling.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, life at home helps shape academic outcomes long before children begin reading books. Family-level supports in the first two years of life help predict achievement years later, in elementary school.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning soon after birth, the most supportive mothers teach the joy of living and learning, through lots of active, encouraging, verbal and nonverbal communication. They engage actively in helping children learn to walk and talk and to explore their new world and manipulate their toys and other objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch mothers exist in large numbers in every racial group. Nonetheless, in a recent study by Harvard's Richard Murnane and co-authors, differences in mother-child interaction patterns like these were found to account for one-third of the black-white gap in math and English skills at the beginning of kindergarten -- and one-quarter at the end of third grade.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs children get older, highly responsive parents spend time with children, look for ways to be helpful and encourage them to voice their opinions. They are good listeners and they teach their children that they have a right to be heard and that people in positions of authority can sometimes be persuaded. The same parents can also be demanding, providing rules and structure and holding children consistently accountable for their behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jelani Mandara of Northwestern University found in a nationally representative sample that students who achieved the highest test scores among blacks, Hispanics and whites had parents who were both responsive and demanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the study, white parents were much more likely to be both responsive and demanding than black and Hispanic parents; whereas black parents, in particular, were often highly demanding, but tended not to be as responsive in the ways the study measured. Among early adolescents, differences along these dimensions helped account for the higher test scores of whites as compared with blacks and Hispanics.\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings like the above should be part of the conversation among black and Hispanic ", "qas": [{"question": "What is improving?", "id": "80b33fe3a59c4d25a5b6f62ae79f93cb", "answers": [{"answer_start": 778, "text": "Test scores and graduation rates"}]}, {"question": "Whose achievement has been improving?", "id": "3c34d01e48c64f5081002fd67a272117", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1119, "text": "Blacks and Hispanics"}]}, {"question": "What will the vitality of the U.S. depend on?", "id": "9c7364bc94374e31a097ba17c443cd18", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1092, "text": "closing these racial gaps."}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- John Spieker stood on the back porch of h", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- John Spieker stood on the back porch of his newly rented Bailey, Colorado, home, thankful for his Good Samaritan landlord and worried that his previous home, parked in the driveway, wouldn't get him to work the next day.\n\n\n\nJohn and Katie Spieker stand next to their camper with baby son, Jacob.\n\n\n\nHis 1977 Toyota Dolphin camper, which Spieker rescued from a salvage yard, had carried him, his wife, Katie, and 4-month-old son, Jacob, from Florida to Colorado earlier this summer, a cross-country sojourn in search of work.\n\n\n\nHe was uncertain it could handle the 14-mile commute the next morning, but he'd make do.\n\n\n\n\"I'm gonna get up extra early every morning like I have been, and if it [the camper] doesn't get to work, I'm gonna hitchhike,\" Spieker said last week. \"I have a wife and a son to support.\"\n\n\n\nSpieker had been making $12 an hour plus commission at his information technology job in Trenton, Florida.

He played the role of George H.W. Bush in practice debates with Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and with Michael Dukakis in 1988, and practice debated Bill Clinton more than 20 times during the 1992 campaign. He also played the role of Dick Cheney in 2000 and 2004 and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for 23 primary debates for the 2008 nomination. Barnett spoke with CNNI's Michael Holmes.\n\n\n\nRobert Barnett has been in practice debates with Democrats from Geraldine Ferraro to Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nCNN: How does Tuesday night's town hall format differ from other debates?\n\n\n\nBarnett: The individuals will not necessarily express the question as a journalist would. So, for example, one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341, but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation.\n\n\n\nAnd so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question, because if you don't, you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners.\n\n\n\nCNN: You're in a unique position. You have prepped, I think, seven or eight presidential campaigns. You've done debate prep, you've stood in and played the role of Dick Cheney and others. What's that like? What are you trying to do to prepare the candidate, any candidate?\n\n\n\nBarnett:  If I'm playing the surrogate, if you will, if I'm the Republican for a Democrat, I try to prepare myself -- not to imitate; I'm not Darrell Hammond or Dana Carvey. I'm not that talented. But I try to be ready with what my candidate that I'm playing, if you will, has said -- the exact words used, the way they counterattack, the way they attack.\n\n\n\nAnd I try to make sure that the candidate I'm working with, meaning the Democrat, has heard just about everything that they could hear from their opponent before they ever walk on the stage.\n\n\n\nCNN: Do you try to bait them, get them to bite a little and then say that's not what you should be doing?\n\n\n\nBarnett: Well, it can get pretty contested. When I prepared with Rep. Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 when she was running against then-vice president George Herbert Walker Bush, I baited her a lot and she got so angry with me that she frequently walked over to me and slugged me on the arm. So I left the process black and blue.\n\n\n\nCNN: When you're doing that sort of thing, how direct can you be with the candidate? Or do you have to treat them with a bit of kid gloves?\n\n\n\nBarnett: I treat them with no kid gloves.

Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001.\n\n\"Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,\" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. \"Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source.\"\n\nJames Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade.\n\n\"We share the U.N.'s concerns,\" Appathurai told CNN. \"Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation.\"\n\nHe said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly.\n\n\"The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,\" Appathurai said.\n\nFarming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said.\n\nHowever, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked.\n\nAccording to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes.\n\nCosta said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region.\n\nHe called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors.\n\n\"Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,\" the U.N. drug chief said.\n\nAppathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production.\n\n\"You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,\" he said.

Last week, jurors received new instructions on the law and were told to start over after the foreman declared the panel was deadlocked 7-5.\n\n\n\nThe jury's inability to reach a verdict capped a five-month trial that played like a Hollywood film noir classic -- with a twist of the bizarre.\n\n\n\nA 6-foot-tall, blue-eyed blonde with a toothpaste commercial smile, Clarkson was known for her roles in \"Barbarian Queen\" and \"Amazon Women on the Moon.\" But at 40 the parts were few and far between and she had taken a $9-an-hour job as a VIP hostess at the House of Blues in Hollywood.\n\n\n\nSpector invented the \"wall of sound\" in the 1960s and worked with the Beatles, Ike and Tina Turner and other acts. Normally reclusive, Spector had spent a rare night out on the town, found Clarkson at the House of Blues at closing time and invited her home for a drink in the wee hours of February 3, 2003.\n\n\n\nAfter initially turning him down, she agreed to accompany him, according to testimony.\n\n\n\nHours later, police were summoned to Spector's mansion in Alhambra, a suburb of Los Angeles. The diminutive music producer had wandered into the driveway in the predawn and told his Brazilian-born chauffeur, \"I think I killed somebody,\" according to the driver's testimony.\n\n\n\nClarkson was found inside, slumped in a chair in the foyer. She had been shot in the mouth. A .38-caliber Colt Special revolver lay at her feet. It appeared someone had attempted to clean up the blood with a diaper found in the guest bathroom.\n\n\n\nSpector's attorneys argued that Clarkson  was depressed over a recent breakup, grabbed the gun and  took her own life.\n\n\n\nBut prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace, with five women telling harrowing tales on the witness stand of the music producer threatening them with firearms. Spector's driver testified he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\"\n\n\n\nAt issue was whether Spector pulled the trigger -- or whether Clarkson did. In photos projected on a large screen, the gruesome crime scene resembled a set decorated for a horror film.\n\n\n\nIn all, 77 witnesses testified and more than 600 pieces of evidence were submitted.

I found Iran to be perhaps the most misunderstood and fascinating land I've ever visited. And I learned a lot.\n\nThe country is not free. It seems that people -- motivated by fear of Western influences and love of their children -- have forgone democracy for their theocracy. Parents told me, \"We do not want our girls to grow up to be Britney Spears,\" and they are willing to sacrifice some freedom to achieve that goal. They feel their \"revolution of values\" provides an environment where they can raise their children free from the cheap sex, drug abuse and crass materialism of the West.\n\nIranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead. After several days, that provocative tuft attracted my eye like cleavage. Making sure that what they can show is as beautiful as possible, Iranian women, per capita, lead the world in nose jobs. Faces are beautifully made up, and -- when so much else is covered -- can be particularly expressive and mysterious. Eye contact is riveting.\n\nBefore arriving in Iran, I was so afraid of anti-Americanism that we had nearly left our big expensive TV camera in Athens and considered flying in with a less obtrusive model. But once there, I found people curious, courteous and quick to smile -- especially when they learned we were American. I've never had such fun with people or found them so chatty than on the streets of Iran.\n\nTehran is modern and bustling, with thriving shopping malls, cars clogging the streets and most people wearing Western-style clothes. Unlike many Muslim capitals, minarets do not dot the skyline, and I barely heard a call to prayer.\n\nAnd yet it's clearly a theocracy. Multiple TV stations broadcast religious programming (along with BBC and CNN) that's perfect for praying -- images of the sun setting on the sea, or the pilgrimage center in Mecca in real-time. In the United States, billboards and ads encourage us to consume, but in Iran, government-sponsored billboards, Muzak and TV programming is all about the teachings of great holy men.\n\nI asked my guide if it's okay to be non-Muslim in Iran. \"Yes,\" he said, \"We have religious freedom, as long as it is not offensive to Islam.\" Christian? \"Sure.\" Jewish? \"Sure.\" Bahai? \"No. We believe that Mohammed -- who came in the 7th century -- was the last prophet, so the Bahai prophet (19th century) is offensive to Islam.\"\n\nI asked, \"What if you want to get somewhere in the military or government?\"\n\nMy guide answered, \"Then you better be a Muslim -- a practicing, Shiite Muslim.\"\n\nEvery film crew stops at the former U.S. Embassy. It was here in 1979 that a gang of revolutionary students stormed what they called the \"Den of Spies\" and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. For Iranians back then, it was a proud moment of triumph against the nation that had meddled in their affairs for years. The embassy wall is still covered with anti-American murals painted at that time. But the hostage crisis was 30 years ago. Most Iranians weren't even born then. It's ancient history to our young guide.\n\nWith our work done, we hurried to catch our flight home.

The blast left 11 people aboard the rig presumed dead and uncorked a gusher of oil that has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nLandry's testimony came on the first of two days of hearings by a joint Coast Guard-Interior Department panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis ship picked up the rig's survivors, and Landry said the rig's captain, Curt Kutcha, told him he had tried to activate a \"kill switch\" that would cut off the well before abandoning the structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crew did not know whether it was working when they fled the burning rig, Landry told investigators.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department agency that oversees offshore oil exploration, inspects drill rigs once a month, MMS inspector Eric Neal told the panel.

The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called \"Vows of Chastity.\"\n\n\n\nIt's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, \"Antichrist\" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named.\n\n\n\nThe prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.)\n\n\n\nDafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman.\n\n\n\nOf course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against \"Hostel,\" \"Saw\" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably.\n\n\n\nHiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse.\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: \"Chaos reigns!\" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch.\n\n\n\nThis director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance.\n\n\n\nApparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery.

But Obama did not win the White House on hype, any more than he won it on hope.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe won it with an organization that even opponents called brilliant. He won it with a clear strategy that was stuck to with remarkably little internal drama. He won it with unparalleled fundraising and an overwhelming ground game. And he won it after facing various challenges and turning them to his advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning points\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning Iowa: Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses knocked almost all of his Democratic competitors out in the first nominating contest, and it pushed the \"inevitable\" Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, back on her heels. He'd built an organization strong enough to haul supporters out of their homes on a frigid January night to debate, harangue and cajole their neighbors into backing him. Tens of thousands of new voters became the key to his Iowa win and revealed the outline of a general election plan: Create a wide coalition to bring new voters to the polls in record numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nTed Kennedy: Within weeks of Iowa, all of Obama's Democratic competitors had dropped out of the race except for Clinton, who split the races with him in the run-up to Super Tuesday. It was then that Ted Kennedy, head of the only Democratic family to outrank the Clintons, came out for Obama, comparing the Illinois senator to his assassinated brother, President John F. Kennedy. The move was deeply symbolic, not just for the public but also the party. The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing race: Race was always going to be a factor in Obama's campaign, even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it. Clips of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his longtime pastor, making hateful remarks hit the Internet and television and put Obama on defense. He responded with a speech in March hailed by commentators as among the most thoughtful ever delivered on race by an American politician. When Wright went further, so did Obama -- condemning him outright and later quitting his church. All this time, black voters were rallying behind Obama, switching their allegiance from Clinton in such large numbers that party elders, such as civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, had to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nFundraising: Flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors, Obama announced in June he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976. McCain hammered Obama for reneging on a promise to stick with public financing, but the issue failed to resonate with voters. Obama kept raising and spending record amounts of money, using it to send staff across the country -- even to dozens of states Democrats hadn't won in years -- and to swamp the airwaves with advertising.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Clinton: The long and bitter primary battle turned many Clinton supporters off Obama. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll a month after Obama sealed the nomination found that nearly 50 percent of Clinton's supporters did not plan to vote for Obama in November. McCain tried to exploit the Democrats' divisions and attract Clinton supporters to his side, but the former rivals came together to stop that. Obama and Clinton worked behind the scenes to create a show of public unity, epitomized by Clinton dramatically marching onto the convention floor in Denver to call for the party to nominate Obama by acclamation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debates: Obama won all three debates ", "qas": [{"question": "What was important in his success?", "id": "0a8dca68f6c5497e9a6bbe453f46fb7c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 767, "text": "stuck to with remarkably little internal drama.

Immediately, their minds turned to their 7-year-old daughter, Morgan, who was upstairs getting ready for bed.\n\n\n\nAn injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.\n\n\n\nTwo days earlier, Morgan, her father, and brother had been playing baseball in the yard of their Mentor, Ohio, home when her father hit a line drive that landed just above Morgan's left temple. A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour.\n\n\n\n\"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine,\" Donald McCracken says. \"She had no symptoms. She went to school both days and got an A on her spelling test as usual. There were no issues whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\nBut after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed. After all, Richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury.\n\n\n\nWhen they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache. \"Because of Natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nThe McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.\n\n\n\n\"I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,\" McCracken said.\n\n\n\nWhen the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.\n\n\n\nMcCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. \"My heart sank,\" he says. \"It just sank.\"\n\n\n\nUnlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. \"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,\" McCracken says.\n\n\n\nNow the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor?\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,\" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER \u00bb\n\n\n\nIn most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. \"They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBut then there's what doctors call the \"talk and die\" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.\n\n\n\n\"Talk and die\" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. \"Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,\" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, \"the deterioration can happen very quickly.\"\n\n\n\nHere, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.\n\n\n\n1.

Martin says Lifeway Christian Stores should be given hell for its actions against GospelToday.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- In the 19 years that Teresa Hairston has published her magazine, GospelToday, she has never faced a major situation with Christian bookstores across the country that carry the publication.\n\n\n\nShe's tackled any number of issues over the years,and has featured a number of celebrities and ministers, ranging from Yolanda Adams to Bishop T.D. Jakes to Kirk Franklin.\n\n\n\nBut when the Atlanta, Georgia, entrepreneur decided to feature five female pastors on her cover this month, she says, Lifeway Christian Stores treated her like she had converted her Christian publication to something akin to the tastes of porn purveyor Larry Flynt.\n\n\n\nApparently, the owner of Lifeway, the Southern Baptist Convention, wasn't too happy with Hairston telling the story of female pastors, because the women go against their 2000 decree that only men can serve in the role of reverend or pastor.\n\n\n\nAccording to Hairston, the Christian company didn't even give her the courtesy of a heads-up.\n\n\n\n\"We got an anonymous tip,\" she told me Tuesday on The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and after checking it out, she discovered that the magazine had been removed from the shelves in all of Lifeway's 100-plus stores nationwide and had been placed behind the counter.\n\n\n\n\"They have never called me,\" Hairston said. \"Never sent an e-mail. Nothing. I had to go see my distributor to verify what they had done.\"\n\n\n\nThe actions of Lifeway didn't stun me. I had seen this movie before.\n\n\n\nA few years ago, my wife was a longtime Lifeway teacher. She had taught at the company's teaching centers for years, but then one day, she was notified that she would have to take down her Web site and comply with their rules against female pastors or be dropped as a teacher. Her crime? Calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't that she did so for the heck of it. She graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary; was the first female staff pastor at Houston's Brookhollow Baptist Church/the Church Without Walls, a Southern Baptist Convention church; and has been leading folks to the Lord all over the country for 20 years.\n\n\n\nShe was angered by Lifeway's decision but made it clear that she didn't serve the bookstore or even the Southern Baptist Convention. She made a commitment to serving Jesus Christ and was not about to back away from her call to ministry because a male-dominated organization decided that its interpretation of the Bible calls for a woman not to be in the pulpit.\n\n\n\nSo she cut them off and kept on calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin.\n\n\n\nReligious folks will quickly say that Scripture is clear that women can't be pastors and lead men, yet Hairston says that when she featured Pastor Paula White on her cover two years ago, Lifeway didn't take any action against the magazine.\n\n\n\nAnyone who has served in a church or been a member of any faith knows that there are those who have strict interpretations of their faith's writings, while others have a different interpretation.\n\n\n\nI've heard Brookhollow's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Ralph Douglas West Sr., preach several sermons stating that what Paul wrote in 2 Timothy with regards to only men preaching was specific to that church and not a blanket ban. Second, there were instances where Paul wrote that his views were his own and not mandates from God.\n\n\n\nThat is a doctrinal fight that any of us can have any time (and I love it how these same Bible thumpers ignore ", "qas": [{"question": "What kind of publication was placed behind store counters?", "id": "b7377028d0274399b8189b9562f5bb1d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1672, "text": "magazine"}]}, {"question": "Who owns Lifeway stores?", "id": "64e4eebd844f4487b8aef254b3a7bf0c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1239, "text": "Southern Baptist Convention,"}]}, {"question": "Who was featured on the magazine's cover?", "id": "47d30bda511f43808d50a044925ef722", "answers": [{"answer_start": 995, "text": "five"}]}, {"question": "What did Martin say about Lifeway?", "id": "6f3ed56417de4830bb62a1de86cee38f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 478, "text": "Christian Stores should be given hell for its actions against GospelToday."}]}, {"question": "What was on the cover of the magazine?", "id": "89b7bbc7406a47cfbb086010e72d1331", "answers": [{"answer_start": 995, "text": "five"}]}, {"question": "Who was featured on the cover?", "id": "736112d0d87748f0943c9088c28a57a2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 995, "text": "five"}]}, {"question": "Where did Lifeway stores put Christian magazine?", "id": "af104d8adfb148d68ee36715cbbd0d7c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1775, "text": "placed behind the counter."}]}, {"question": "What was featured on the cover of the magazine?", "id": "2158e5af296446b2b3cef69beb058717", "answers": [{"answer_start": 836, "text": "celebrities"}]}, {"question": "Who put a Christian magazine behind the counter?", "id": "3dfb0ef71f1e4c4b88695ca0bcb4add2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1725, "text": "Lifeway's 100-plus stores nationwide"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN)  -- English Premier League Fulham produced a", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- English Premier League Fulham produced a superb performance in Switzerland on Wednesday to eliminate opponents Basel from the Europa League with a 3-2 victory.\n\n\n\nRoy Hodgson's men went into the away game needing victory to leapfrog their opponents and join Group E winners AS Roma in the last 32 of Europe's second-tier club competition.\n\n\n\nFulham were led by striker Bobby Zamora, who capped a recent scoring spree with two goals just before halftime.\n\n\n\nBasel hit back with a disputed penalty before Zoltan Gera put Fulham 3-1 ahead with a neat finish.\n\n\n\nBut a Marco Streller 87th minute strike for the home side set up a nervous finish for the visitors, who survived to reach the knockout stages.\n\n\n\nRoma beat CSKA Sofia in the group's other match with Alessandro Cerci scornig twice.\n\n\n\nIn Group F, French star Djibril Cisse scored a late double as Panathinaikos booked their passage with a 3-0 home win over Dinamo Bucharest.\n\n\n\nAnte Rukavina set the Greek giants on their way to the last 32 with a 55th-minute strike.\n\n\n\nTurkish side Galatasaray won the group but lost 1-0 to Austria's Sturm Graz, who scored through Daniel Beichler.\n\n\n\nIn Group D, Bundesliga Hertha Berlin beat Sporting Lisbon of Portugal 1-0 through Gojko Kacar's second half strike.\n\n\n\nIt meant Dutch side Heerenveen were eliminated despite a 5-0 home victory over FK Ventspils.\n\n\n\nSecond-half goals from Gerard Sibon, who scored twice, Mika Vayrynen, Viktor Elm and Darryl Janmaat gave Heerenveen victory, but Hertha's win spoiled their celebrations.

A 9 mm handgun was found inside, on the second floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nA university spokesman, Ray Garner, identified the dead as Gopi Podila, chairman of the biological sciences department; Maria Davis, associate professor of biology; and Adriel Johnson, associate professor of biology.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiller said his client is \"trying to keep from cracking up down there emotionally,\" and is worried that if she breaks down, officials in the jail might think she's going to commit suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing his client's mind, he said that doctors of biology \"have got, in my estimation, high IQs -- and the high IQ in my opinion is sometimes not good for people.\" He said Bishop sometimes is \"so focused on the mental basis\" that she \"does not know what's going on around her.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he believes the case will boil down to Bishop's mental state at the time of the killings.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the shootings, information came to light about previous run-ins with the law Bishop had. She faced criminal charges after an altercation at a Massachusetts restaurant nearly eight years ago, police said. The police report says Bishop became furious that there was no booster seat available for her child, began screaming at the woman who had taken the last one and struck her in the head.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shooting was ruled accidental, but after a review of the incident after the Alabama shootings, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating issued a statement saying that probable cause had existed in 1986 to charge Bishop with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the statute of limitations on those charges has expired, as well as on a potential charge of \"wanton and reckless conduct\" -- the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, Keating said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Boston Globe reported Monday that Bishop and her husband, Jim Anderson, were questioned in the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor.\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Anderson said on Monday that federal investigators had gathered \"a dozen subjects\" in the attempted bombing, but \"there were never any ", "qas": [{"question": "Bishop was charged with what?", "id": "b583c0af110a4ab99bd001f7c487baae", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1074, "text": "capital murder and three counts of attempted"}]}, {"question": "When was the faculty meeting?", "id": "527ce6c8c0fb4e34a273e792ef21446d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1186, "text": "last week."}]}, {"question": "What is Miller's first name?", "id": "ccc7685833724221ac2c3f779dbbfadd", "answers": [{"answer_start": 190, "text": "Roy"}]}, {"question": "what has roy miller said", "id": "9662731a19dd4d7eb774368c797ff071", "answers": [{"answer_start": 206, "text": "\"something's wrong with this lady.\""}]}, {"question": "What is Bishop charged with?", "id": "16a9d0ec55594c81a528e59ddb908fee", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1074, "text": "capital murder and three counts of attempted murder"}]}, {"question": "Lawyer told reporters he regrets calling client Amy Bishop what?", "id": "04a914d3e5484f15bce5c235722323ff", "answers": [{"answer_start": 150, "text": "\"wacko.\""}]}, {"question": "what did the lawyer say", "id": "35110c01e79f454299244040123f6ef2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 121, "text": "he regrets describing her as \"wacko.\""}]}, {"question": "Who called Bishop \"wacko?\"", "id": "5a3b5274b19141bf9e88083177746248", "answers": [{"answer_start": 190, "text": "Roy Miller"}]}]}]}, {"title": "NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Two U.S. filmmakers were i", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Two U.S. filmmakers were injured Saturday when their small plane crashed into a three-story residential building in downtown Nairobi.\n\n\n\nPeople gather around the wreckage of a plane that struck a building in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Saturday.\n\n\n\nDan Parris, 25, and Rob Lehr, 26, both from St. Louis, Missouri, were shooting an independent documentary on poverty in Africa.\n\n\n\nBoth men were hospitalized and expected to survive, according to David Peterka, who was part of the film crew, but was not aboard the plane.

After momentarily losing sight of Peterson, Carter \"heard multiple rounds of gunfire\" and his windshield burst.\n\n\n\nPeterson escaped.

Bobby Jindal in a prime-time exclusive interview Monday night.\n\nLousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Barack Obama: \"I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is.\"\n\nJindal gave the Republican response after President Obama's address to Congress last week. Jindal received negative reviews after the speech, and Larry asked him how he felt about that. They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nLarry King: Governor, you took a lot of flak for that speech. Were you surprised that you did?\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal: Let's be clear, the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we've seen in a generation. I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is. And I'm not the only one that's got that opinion.\n\nI hope people look at the content of the speech, not just the delivery. You know, for years, I've been told I speak too quickly. Now I'm told I speak too slowly.\n\nWhat's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package, with the leadership in Congress, with the administration. I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again. We need to put more money in the private sector.  Watch Larry King's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal \u00c2\u00bb\n\nLet's cut taxes. Let's get rid of the wasteful spending. That's the debate. That's the discussion we need to be having.\n\nKing: But governor, to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis, when in some cases, they are the only answer, that pointed to a lot of the criticism, didn't it?\n\nJindal: If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described, I think you'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support. We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway.\n\nLess than 5 percent of this bill was actually [for] the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described.  ...\n\nFundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs.\n\nKing: There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry. No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit.\n\nJindal: Well, Larry, I think that you're absolutely right. One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party didn't match its actions with its rhetoric. ...\n\nI think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture. The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side.\n\nKing: Governor, if perception is reality, do you think your speech hurt the party?\n\nJindal: I think that people are going to look at the content. I think people are going to be focused now that we've [got] alternative views on how to move our country forward.\n\nLet me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get. Whenever we can find areas of agreement, we need to work across the aisle and put America first.\n\nBut when we disagree, we need to offer principled alternative solutions. So for example, in health care, I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American.

Already this month 11 people have been killed by lightning in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe same week, a 33-year-old man was struck while jogging in Texas, a 70-year-old California woman was hit while doing yard work and a Kentucky man, 44, fell victim while waiting under a tree for a ride.\n\n\n\nThey are among 11 people killed already this month by lightning strikes in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\n\n\"Lightning is very random in terms of fatalities,\" National Weather Service lightning safety expert John Jensensius told CNN. \"We normally see a good amount of lightning in June, but this is unusually high. There really is no good explanation of why that's the case.\"\n\n\n\nSix of the 15 lightning-strike deaths in the U.S. so far this year occurred in California, Texas and Florida, with the rest scattered through the South, Midwest and West. No deaths have occurred in the Northeast so far, \"likely due to the cool, damp pattern we've seen in New England,\" Jensensius said. \"There have been less severe thunderstorms there.\"\n\n\n\nSummer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors. This week, the first official week of summer, marks \"Lightning Safety Awareness Week\" for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\n\nThe agency's message is \"When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors.\" That's because all the people killed by lightning in the U.S. so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors. Taking shelter under trees offers little safety -- nearly one-third of the people killed by lightning last year were under a tree when they were hit.\n\n\n\nMore than 400 people in the U.S. are hit by lightning each year, according to the National Weather Service. Lightning, on average, kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined (among all weather-related fatalities, only floods kill more). While not all injuries result in death, many victims are left with devastating and permanent disabilities.\n\n\n\nYou may remember that as a child you were told to count the seconds between a lightning flash and thunder to see how far away the lightning was. But by the time you calculate it, it may be too late. Sometimes thunder and lightning can happen simultaneously.\n\n\n\nDespite its \"Sunshine State\" nickname, Florida receives more cloud-to-ground lightning than any other state in the country, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\n\n\nBut Florida does not receive the most lightning in the world. According to NASA research, that dubious honor goes to the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 158 strikes per square kilometer each year. Thunderstorms occur in Central Africa year-round.\n\n\n\nHere are some commonly asked lightning questions:\n\n\n\nHow powerful is lightning?\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, \"each spark of lightning can reach over five miles in length, soar to temperatures of approximately 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit and contain 100 million electrical volts.\"\n\n\n\nCan wearing rubber shoes protect you from lightning?\n\n\n\nNo. That's a myth, and there are lots of them out there.

The Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamist movement that had claimed control of the capital Mogadishu earlier that year.\n\n\n\nEthiopia's invasion had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. But various Islamist groups -- including the hard-line Al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government.\n\n\n\nEthiopia announced on Sunday that all its forces have left Somalia. Last week, as Ethiopian troops began pulling out of the Somali capital, forces from different Islamist groups -- including Al-Shabab -- took control of bases the Ethiopians abandoned around Mogadishu.\n\n\n\nThe transitional government maintained very little control outside of Baidoa, even with the support of the Ethiopian forces. It has also been wracked by an internal power struggle between Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, who resigned in December.\n\n\n\nIn Washington, the State Department said U.S. officials are working to independently confirm the reports from Baidoa. But State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said members of one of the major Islamic factions, which signed a peace agreement in October in Djibouti, are already joining the transitional government.\n\n\n\nDuguid said the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, another offshoot of the ICU, will choose up to 200 new members of the transitional parliament. Another 75 members will be drawn from other opposition groups, and the expanded parliament is expected to elect a new president soon.\n\n\n\n\"We remain deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in southern Somalia, which continues to claim innocent lives,\" Duguid said. \"Lasting peace and stability in Somalia can only be established through the reconciliation process underway through the Djibouti Agreement and rejection of extremism.\"\n\n\n\nWith Monday's takeover of Baidoa, the transitional government only has control of the presidential palace in the Somali capital of Mogadishu and the road to the airport in the capital city, which it holds with the help of African Union forces.\n\n\n\nCNN's Ben Brumfield and journalists Mohamed Amiin Adow and Omar Faruk Osman contributed to this report.", "qas": [{"question": "Where were the country's lawmakers stranded?", "id": "d5ba53a46f9b4a1bb0fbe9dcfd80ddf0", "answers": [{"answer_start": 890, "text": "Djibouti,"}]}, {"question": "who seized control?", "id": "7554be436374465c81b24a7a2e0bd4c1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 17, "text": "Islamist fighters"}]}]}]}, {"title": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- One of the the country's most", "paragraphs": [{"context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- One of the the country's most powerful unions stepped up its campaign for a hotly disputed labor bill Monday, holding a rally on the eve of the bill's formal introduction in Congress.\n\n\n\nWorkers rally in support of the Employee Free Choice act in Lafayette Square in Washington on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe legislation -- the Employee Free Choice Act -- would create an alternate process for bringing a union into a workplace.\n\n\n\nIt is supported by President Barack Obama and the Democratic congressional leadership, but is fiercely opposed by most congressional Republicans and corporate leaders, who fear it will saddle a sagging business community with new burdens at the worst possible time.\n\n\n\nBusiness leaders \"believe in this old market-worshipping, privatizing, deregulating, trickle-down [policy] that took the greatest economy on the Earth and sent it staggering forward because of their greed and their selfishness,\" declared Service Employees International Union President Andy Stern.\n\n\n\n\"Without the Employee Free Choice Act ... the rich will get richer and the rest of us will fend for ourselves.\"\n\n\n\nSterns issued his warning as his 1.8 million-member union prepared for a daylong Capitol Hill lobbying blitz on behalf of the bill Tuesday.\n\n\n\nDemocrats and Republicans may disagree sharply over the merits of the legislation, but leaders on both sides of the aisle freely admit it has the potential to significantly reshape the balance of power between business and labor for the first time in years.\n\n\n\nThe controversial act would allow employees to signal support for unionizing by openly signing a card demanding it. If a majority signed, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate union representation.\n\n\n\nIt would also stiffen federal laws barring employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union.\n\n\n\nThe traditional option to vote by secret ballot would still be available.

The family-owned company has been under fire from the SEIU, which argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years.\n\n\n\nBego said the claims are unfounded, and it's the union that has harassed him.\n\n\n\nHe said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and even released balloons in a client's building to disrupt business. But he told CNN his workers don't want a union because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU's labor dues.\n\n\n\n\"We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone],\" Bego said. \"They've been after us for almost three years, and they've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said.

But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of \"brain hacking\" should be taken seriously.\n\n\n\n\"Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future,\" said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington.\n\n\n\n\"But if we don't start paying attention to security, we're worried that we might find ourselves in five or 10 years saying we've made a big mistake.\"\n\n\n\nHackers tap into personal computers all the time. But what would happen if they focused their nefarious energy on neural devices, such as the deep-brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson's and depression, or electrode systems for controlling prosthetic limbs?\n\n\n\nAccording to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks. But as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread, the potential for security breaches will mushroom.\n\n\n\n\"It's very hard to design complex systems that don't have bugs,\" Kohno said. \"As these medical devices start to become more and more complicated, it gets easier and easier for people to overlook a bug that could become a very serious risk. It might border on science fiction today, but so did going to the moon 50 years ago.\"\n\n\n\nSome might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else's brain, but the researchers say there's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm. In November 2007 and March 2008, malicious programmers vandalized epilepsy support Web sites by putting up flashing animations, which caused seizures in some photo-sensitive patients.\n\n\n\n\"It happened on two separate occasions,\" said computer science graduate student Tamara Denning, a co-author on the paper. \"It's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples' health using computers, especially if neural devices become more widespread.\"\n\n\n\nIn some cases, patients might even want to hack into their own neural device. Unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs, which still use wires, many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals. Hacking into these devices could enable patients to \"self-prescribe\" elevated moods or pain relief by increasing the activity of the brain's reward centers.\n\n\n\nDespite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind. Neural engineers carefully consider the safety and reliability of new equipment, and neuroethicists focus on whether a new device fits ethical guidelines. But until now, few groups have considered how neural devices might be hijacked to perform unintended actions. This is the first time an academic paper has addressed the topic of \"neurosecurity,\" a term the group coined to describe their field.\n\n\n\n\"The security and privacy issues somehow seem to slip by,\" Kohno said. \"I would not be surprised if most people working in this space have never thought about security.\"\n\n\n\nKevin Otto, a bioengineer who studies brain-machine interfaces at Purdue Universty, said he was initially skeptical of the research. \"When I first picked up the paper, I don't know if I agreed that it was an issue. But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important, and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers.\"\n\n\n\nIt's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research. But he stressed that the kinds of devices available today are not susceptible to attack, and that fear of future risks shouldn't impede progress in the field. \"These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology,\" Williams said", "qas": [{"question": "What are the slim risks?", "id": "20bdba32de3c4cd3829be8b6b99a004e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 501, "text": "\"brain hacking\""}]}, {"question": "What says expert security?", "id": "9630268d37cf48ef8fe8d155ad2298b8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 547, "text": "\"Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future,\" said computer"}]}, {"question": "Who can use thoughts to operate computers?", "id": "bd3b71b3e5014081a2bd8383ab23111c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 139, "text": "Scientists"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- It's amazing how a huge global phenomenon", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- It's amazing how a huge global phenomenon can begin.\n\n\n\nTetris, the simple puzzle video game, has been addicting players for 25 years.\n\n\n\nIn 1984, Russian mathematician Alexey Pajitnov was playing with one of his favorite puzzles when he had an inspiration: How about creating a computer version?\n\n\n\nPajitnov wrote the program in his spare time, simplifying the idea to make it easier for those of us who aren't math geniuses.\n\n\n\nHe used shapes made of four squares -- hence \"Tetris,\" which comes from the Greek word for four, \"Tetra.\"\n\n\n\nIn the game, players must position and stack blocky shapes to fill a grid without leaving spaces in between.

According to Brinley, the Challenger appeals to Baby Boomers who like styling and power. But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y. Surprisingly, this beats out the Prius, a more forward-looking vehicle; only 18-percent of its buyers are Gen X or Y.\n\n\n\nAuto Pacific's data shows that the Dodge Challenger is winning buyers too young to remember the original 1970-74 Challenger. \"All ages stop and stare at this car,\" said Bell. \"Especially when it's in Hemi Orange, from old-skool Hot Rodders to the Import Tuner crowd.\" This wide appeal makes pegging the Challenger owner more challenging.\n\n\n\nFord F-150: Working man's truck\n\n\n\nAccording to Auto Pacific data, the driver of a Ford F-150 work truck (a plain, regular-cab model), is an employed man.

It is the first day of June and our last week before summer break. Thank you very much for joining us.\n\n\n\nFirst Up: A Look Back\n\n\n\nAZUZ: First up, a major move for the country's largest automaker as General Motors is expected to file for bankruptcy today. This comes one month after Chrysler, another of the so-called \"Big Three\" U.S. car companies, did the very same thing. Under the terms of General Motors' bankruptcy, the company will be reorganized and essentially taken over by the government. Thirty years ago, GM made up more than 40 percent of U.S. auto sales. Today, that number is 19 percent. The company's reported more than $90 billion in losses since 2005. As the bankruptcy process begins, Christine Romans looks back at the history of GM and the American car.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nCHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Henry Ford started at the beginning of the last century with four wheels and a running board; 1908 was the birth of American car culture. That same year, General Motors was formed in Flint, Michigan. It wasn't until 1925 when the \"Big Three\" was complete with the formation of Chrysler Corporation.\n\n\n\nJOHN DAVIS, HOST, MOTORWEEK: When the Big Three emerged, they not only emerged as rivals that really gave Americans much better automobiles at the time, but they also cemented the American automobile as a world standard.\n\n\n\nROMANS: \"As goes General Motors, so goes the nation.\" That phrase defined America's economic power for much of the last century.\n\n\n\nPETER MORICI, ECONOMIST, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: So many folks were either employed at General Motors or the other two major car makers, making steel and all the other components that go into cars. It just meant that if the automobile companies were prospering, the country was prospering, too.\n\n\n\nROMANS: Today, there are 74,000 rank-and-file GM workers in the U.S. But in its heyday, GM was the largest industrial company in the world; a technology leader. By 1979, 600,000 people worked for GM. Those good jobs helped build America's middle class.\n\n\n\nDAVIS: It also allowed us to migrate out from the cities to have the quarter lot in a suburb, to basically get away from a lot of the congestion of the metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\nROMANS: General Moters was the company that revolutionized what we drove, how we thought about our cars, and how we paid for them. GM invented auto loans and the model year. It was the first to hire designers instead of engineers to create new car concepts; think big fins and chrome of the 1950s and 60s. And everything changed. Ford adopted flashy fins with the Ford Fairlane, as did Chrysler with the popular Desoto. Automobiles from the Big Three put their stamp on popular culture, from music to movies to television. What's considered to be the first rock and roll song ever recorded was \"Rocket 88\" by Ike Turner, about a GM product. The Pontiac GTO, considered by many to be the first true muscle car, was showcased in a song by Ronnie and the Daytonas.\n\n\n\nRONNIE AND THE DAYTONAS, \"LITTLE GTO\": Little GTO, you really....\n\n\n\nROMANS: The Corvette on Route 66. The 1948 Ford in the iconic movie \"Grease.\"\n\n\n\nFROM \"GREASE\": Go grease lighting, go grease lighting...\n\n\n\nROMANS: The TransAm in Smokey and the Bandit, and Archie Bunker's Old La Salle.\n\n\n\nCARROLL O'CONNOR AND JEAN ", "qas": [{"question": "Take a drive back where?", "id": "abfb70e6902b46239b124dba7b1f52a7", "answers": [{"answer_start": 85, "text": "in time"}]}, {"question": "Who is concerned with security?", "id": "fe42a6cc7a4a4cc1a489093e09b26540", "answers": [{"answer_start": 191, "text": "President Obama"}]}, {"question": "Who has cybersecurity concerns?", "id": "65bfa2010969404a92b8a132ddee9c02", "answers": [{"answer_start": 191, "text": "President Obama"}]}, {"question": "What do they call the campus of the school?", "id": "6af5094254834df995e52a0779f96097", "answers": [{"answer_start": 297, "text": "a model of sustainability."}]}, {"question": "Who's wheels came off?", "id": "3f2f51019a2c490b9fa0950fe702d3ae", "answers": [{"answer_start": 904, "text": "General Motors'"}]}]}]}, {"title": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The photograph is a jarr", "paragraphs": [{"context": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The photograph is a jarring image that shows Nazi Party members, shovels in hand, digging up graves of American soldiers held as slaves by Nazi Germany during World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Nazi Party are forced to dig up mass graves of U.S. soldiers while American GIs look on.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the men dig up the site, U.S. soldiers investigating war crimes stand over them. Two crosses with helmets placed atop them -- the sign of a fallen soldier -- are visible. Two Germans are knee deep in mud. Another, with a handlebar mustache, has the look of a defeated man. The bodies of 22 American soldiers were found in at least seven graves, according to the photographer.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the back of the photo is written, \"Nazi Party members digging up American bodies at Berga.\"   Berga an der Elster was a slave labor camp where 350 U.S. soldiers were beaten, starved, and forced to work in tunnels for the German government. The soldiers were singled out for \"looking like Jews\" or \"sounding like Jews,\" or dubbed as undesirables, according to survivors. More than 100 soldiers perished at the camp or on a forced death march.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was on this day six decades ago, April 23, 1945, when most of the slave labor camp soldiers were liberated by advancing U.S. troops. The emaciated soldiers, many weighing just 80 pounds, had been forced by Nazi commanders to march more than 150 miles before their rescue.  Watch survivor break down in tears over liberation \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new photograph was likely taken in May or June 1945 when U.S. war crimes investigators combed Berga. It was donated earlier this month to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum by Jim Martin and his family, whose father, Elmore \"Bud\" Martin, is believed to have snapped the picture as part of the war crimes investigation team.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photo and dozens of others sat for years in Jim Martin's closet. Some of the photos, including graphic images of American corpses, were placed on record at the National Archives years ago.  See shocking photos of the slave camp \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the image of Nazi Party members digging up graves doesn't appear to be part of that collection. Martin said he was proud to hand over the photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People have to see these. This is something that's history and it belongs with something that's historical to tell that story. It doesn't belong in my closet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To be honest, I'm kind of sorry I haven't done it sooner. We didn't realize what it was.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nElmore Martin, who won a Silver Star for his valor in capturing images during the war, was 28 when he shot the photographs. Before the war, he worked as a photographer for the St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer Press. Martin's son said his dad, who died several years ago, struggled to keep a job when he returned home. \"I now see where it all started,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Elmore Martin and the war crimes soldiers seen in the photo couldn't have known that day was how the case would evolve.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually released in the 1950s. One other Berga commander, Lt. Willy Hack, was executed, but not by the United States. He died by hanging, justice carried out by the Soviets.\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Martin said his father would have been upset at the freeing of the Berga commanders after the atrocities he documented. \"He knew it happened and to see that these people were released would be pretty devastating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEfraim Zuroff, who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust, said the U.S. government commuted the sentences and freed hundreds of war criminals like those at Berga after the war, as the Cold War began to intensify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were more concerned about keeping out Communists than admitting victims of the Nazis", "qas": [{"question": "Where was the photo donated?", "id": "e1c8f7e13689440aa1a4408dd5ea3641", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1630, "text": "U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum"}]}, {"question": "Where was the slave camp located?", "id": "268aaf83d92e42b490cc7f29dacd4167", "answers": [{"answer_start": 797, "text": "Berga an der Elster"}]}, {"question": "What is the new photo showing?", "id": "45207b6ffb714233925df562354b1781", "answers": [{"answer_start": 737, "text": "\"Nazi Party members digging up American bodies at Berga.\""}]}, {"question": "Who was held in the camp?", "id": "4b930ffbea3e483eb80725e988a583a7", "answers": [{"answer_start": 129, "text": "American soldiers"}]}]}]}, {"title": "NORFOLK, Virginia (CNN) -- Negotiators aboard a U.", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NORFOLK, Virginia (CNN) -- Negotiators aboard a U.S. Navy warship are trying to secure the release of an American freighter captain who is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off the coast of Somalia, according to Maersk Line Ltd.\n\nCapt.

It was built in the 1940s as part of the \"Manhattan Project\" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Cold War, Hanford was a buzzing hive of activity, eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean-up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down, and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,\" Peschong said. \"Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner, years sooner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,\" Gill said. \"We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear by watching Gill's team perform their time-consuming daily tasks that Hanford won't be decontanimated quickly. The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear. They break down contaminated equipment through a \"glove box,\" allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves. Each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves, they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. A report by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hanford clean-up \"has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress,\" according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerry Pollet, who runs a Hanford watchdog organization, says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste.

Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline.\n\n\n\nLONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions.\n\n\n\nJet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside.\n\n\n\nThe sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue.\n\n\n\nThis is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency.\n\n\n\nThere is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky.\n\n\n\nPractically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues.\n\n\n\nAviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating.\n\n\n\nPunitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development.\n\n\n\nMeeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake.\n\n\n\nWe identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet.\n\n\n\nThe 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing.\n\n\n\nAircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are.

It was an old bike with a broken belt and I had to fix it. Today, people who don't even know me gave me the greatest gift that a president could have: to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Rio deserves this because Rio is a city that has suffered.\"\n\n\n\nFor Lula da Silva, Friday's announcement in Copenhagen, Denmark, that Rio de Janeiro will host the 31st Olympiad in 2016 signified a major achievement not only for his hemisphere (no city in South America has ever before hosted the games) but for him -- a former autoworker and union organizer who defied dizzying odds to become president.\n\n\n\nLula da Silva was born to a peasant family in one of northeastern Brazil's most impoverished areas and migrated as a young man to a city near S\u00e3o Paulo, where he worked as a metalworker, losing his left pinky finger in the process.\n\n\n\nIn the 1970s, he became a union leader, said Luiz Valente, chairman of the department of Portuguese and Brazilian studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n\n\nDuring the years of military rule from 1964 until 1985, the government cracked down on unions. But Lula da Silva acquired a reputation as a public figure by leading a successful strike in S\u00e3o Paulo, Valente told CNN in a telephone interview.\n\n\n\n\"He was able to negotiate a favorable contract for his union but, from a political standpoint, he demonstrated that worker strikes were possible again in Brazil,\" Valente said.\n\n\n\nDuring the early 1980s, as the military rulers' grip on control loosened, Lula da Silva helped found the leftist Workers' Party.\n\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, he ran for Congress and won, but he chose not to run for re-election. Instead, he set his sights on the top job, waging a losing presidential campaign in 1989, the country's first presidential election since 1960. Successive tries in 1993 and 1997 were unsuccessful, but in 2001, he won and quickly surprised many observers.\n\n\n\n\"When he began, he was perceived as someone very much on the left,\" said Valente. \"He was perceived as being a socialist. However, he has not governed as a socialist. Instead, his economic policies were a continuation of the previous administration's.\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, Brazil's economic policy has been \"pretty much middle of the road, some people would say pretty conservative,\" said Valente, who added that he has never voted for Lula da Silva.\n\n\n\nBut Lula da Silva has worked to help the country's poor, introducing populist measures intended to lower the incidence of poverty and making other moves, Valente said.\n\n\n\n\"As a union leader during the military dictatorship, he learned how to negotiate with the so-called enemy,\" Valente said. \"So Lula is going to try to reach some kind of consensus, and he did. What he did was not a product of ideology but of a pragmatist attitude of the government of Brazil.\"\n\n\n\nLula da Silva's moderate modus operandi has gained him popularity at home, where he has made no moves toward abolishing the term limits that preclude his running for a third term next year, Valente said.\n\n\n\nThat pragmatism has served him well on the international front, where he is on good terms with the leftist governments of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador as well as with the United States and the European Union. \"Lula knows how to play the game,\" Valente said", "qas": [{"question": "which party the president belongs", "id": "361d3843c29e48cb89a94b00c8ff9017", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2138, "text": "Workers'"}]}, {"question": "who says \"the greatest gift that a president could have\"?", "id": "d2ff8a0d87c24abeae1d7612663751d0", "answers": [{"answer_start": 740, "text": "to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro."}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor is having a \"procedure o", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Elizabeth Taylor is having a \"procedure on her heart,\" she announced on her Twitter page Tuesday.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Taylor has used Twitter to share personal information.\n\n\n\n\"It's very new and involves repairing my leaky valve using a clip device, without open heart surgery, so that my heart will function better,\" the famed actress wrote. \"Any prayers you happen to have lying around I would dearly appreciate.

Syed, a junior at Harvard University majoring in government, is an editorial editor at The Harvard Crimson as well as a senior editor and columnist for the Harvard-MIT journal on Islam and society, Ascent. She is chairwoman of the Harvard Institute of Politics Policy Group on Racial Profiling.\n\nNafees Syed says President Obama's early words and actions send a powerful, positive signal to Muslims.\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- President Obama has given the Muslim community around the world the message we have been waiting for.\n\nHe reassured Muslims in America that \"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers.\" For those like me who were critical of his standoffish attitude toward Islam during his campaign, this signaled a welcome change.\n\nEven more important was his subsequent statement: \"To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\"\n\nIn traveling throughout Western Europe in the past two years, I heard several anti-American comments; these Europeans were challenging me, a Muslim, about American foreign policy in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn Muslim countries, I've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like America, followed by accusations that, \"your President Bush doesn't like us Muslims.\"\n\nAs a Muslim-American, I have found myself in a difficult position. In America, I've had to explain Islam to other Americans, and abroad, I've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world.\n\nObama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world. For me personally, it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims. And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions.\n\nIn his first steps as president, Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison, called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process, as special envoy for the Middle East.\n\nFor the past few weeks, I've heard overwhelming praise from Muslims for Obama's recent actions.\n\nObama has recognized a key fact that former President George W. Bush did not: Muslims in America and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other Muslims in the world.\n\nThere is a popular saying of the Prophet Mohammed's that the Muslim community is like one body: If one part hurts, the entire body feels the pain. Muslims are very aware of this message and, in the last 20 years, three conflicts have continuously dominated the Muslim consciousness: Chechnya, Kashmir and, most notably, Palestine.\n\nObama recognized this when he chose his first interview as president to be with a reporter from Al-Arabiya, indicating he would actively engage Arab media. The Palestinian-Israeli issue dominated the interview, with Obama promising to work toward a solution involving both sides of the conflict.\n\nTo understand the challenge Obama faces in changing America's role in the conflict, one must realize the situation he walked into as president. Muslims around the world were watching the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in a Gaza military campaign conducted with a green light from the Bush administration. Obama is essentially trying to rebuild a relationship that has been destroyed.\n\nHowever, Obama's tone of respect and not condescension, a clear break with the past, improves the chances that such a relationship could arise.\n\nHis interview with Al-Arabiya was filled with reassuring statements that America is \"ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest,\" that \"the language we use has to be a language of respect.\" After years of hearing rhetoric of \"a crusade\" and \"Islamofascism\" from the U.S. government, Obama's policy of listening, not dictating, has generated optimism in the Muslim world.\n\nI ", "qas": [{"question": "Who says Muslims worldwide have shared concern about key issues?", "id": "34b9e47ee9754759ab352055e5ec6a0b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 321, "text": "Nafees Syed"}]}, {"question": "What did Obama's interview with Al-Arabiya talk of?", "id": "11f7550099824a199a4b8396d0516ced", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3044, "text": "Palestinian-Israeli issue"}]}, {"question": "Who said anything about Bush?", "id": "0ed9fee4ae4648c08bfd6771e299334c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1178, "text": "Muslim countries,"}]}, {"question": "What is Obama doing?", "id": "b72b19ddb79a4c829f3bcfcb0348f52f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 476, "text": "has given the Muslim community around the world the message we have been waiting for."}]}, {"question": "What Nafees Syed said about Obama`s reaching to Muslim world?", "id": "4d88557eb7e7407d890bcaa9f3f3a2d7", "answers": [{"answer_start": 397, "text": "positive signal"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor knew she wanted to ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor knew she wanted to go into law from an early age.\n\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor says the nomination is the \"most humbling honor \" of her life.\n\n\n\nAs a child, she aspired to be like Nancy Drew, the detective in the popular children's mystery series.

Bush in 1992 and was elevated to her current seat by President Clinton.\n\n\n\nSupporters say her appointment history, along with what they describe as her moderate-liberal views, will give her some bipartisan backing in the Senate.\n\n\n\nSotomayor presided over about 450 cases while on the district court. Prior to her judicial appointments, Sotomayor was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes.\n\n\n\nRobin Kar, who clerked for Sotomayor from 1998 to 1999, described her as a \"warm, extraordinarily kind and caring person.\"  Watch Kar recall his work with Sotomayor \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"She has an amazing story, but she's also just an amazing person,\" he said, adding that she has a knack for getting to know those around her. \"She was the judge who, in the courthouse for example, knew all of the doormen, knew the cafeteria workers, who knew the janitors -- she didn't just know all of the other judges and the politicians.

By 8 p.m., an auxiliary lock was set up to start allowing the half-dozen blocked barges through.\n\n\n\n\"It's going to take more time, but we're keeping the river open tonight,\" Hornback said.\n\n\n\nThe river is a major artery for commodities shipping, with more than 50 million tons of cargo passing through the affected area annually, according to a waterways organization.\n\n\n\nIt was not known what caused the break at the Markland Locks and Dam. Engineers were going to the site, about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky, Hornback said.\n\n\n\nThe lock's gates are 1,200 feet long and 110 feet wide. A smaller auxiliary lock is 600 feet long and 110 feet wide.  Watch traffic backed up on Ohio River \u00bb\n\n\n\nA lock is a section of a waterway, such as a river, that is closed off with gates. Vessels in transit enter the lock and the water level is raised or lowered in order to raise or lower the vessel to adjust to elevation changes.\n\n\n\nOne of the broken portions is known as a miter gate, Hornback said. The Corps of Engineers, on its Web site, says a miter gate \"has two leaves that provide a closure at one end of the lock.\" They are so named because the two leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream and resembling a miter joint, the Web site said, referring to a joint meeting at a 45-degree angle, such as the corner of a picture frame.\n\n\n\nA public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, \"based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates.\"\n\n\n\nThe federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization \"advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways.\"\n\n\n\nHornback said the work was scheduled for 2011, adding that it's unclear whether Sunday's break will speed that up.\n\n\n\n\"The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry,\" the council said in the report last year.\n\n\n\nEngineers hope to have the river back open as soon as possible, Hornback said, but an exact time frame was not known.\n\n\n\nSome 55 million tons of commodities pass through the Markland Locks each year, according to the Waterways Council.

Watch what may lie behind the pick of Bill Clinton \u00bb\n\n\n\nLast month, Clinton's wife -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- said the Obama administration had dropped its request for Ling and Lee to be released on humanitarian grounds and instead was seeking amnesty, which implies forgiveness for an offense.\n\n\n\nThis change in language is an important distinction that could move North Korea to release the women without feeling that its legal system has been slighted, according to analyst Mike Chinoy.\n\n\n\n\"I suspect that it was made pretty clear in advance that Bill Clinton would be able to return with these two women otherwise it would be a terrible loss of face for him,\" said Chinoy, an Edgerton Senior Fellow on Asia at the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. \"The bigger, broader and more important question is what else could be on the agenda. Will Clinton be carrying a letter from Barack Obama for the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il? Will he meet Kim Jong Il?\"\n\n\n\nClinton's mission comes as the United States and its allies in the region are trying to push North Korea back into stalled nuclear disarmament talks. North Korea conducted a nuclear bomb test, its second, in May, and has conducted several missile tests since then. The United Nations responded by tightening and expanding sanctions on the North.\n\n\n\nThe two nations were on opposite sides in the 1950-1953 Korean War and had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea agreed at that time to halt the development of nuclear weapons, but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003.\n\n\n\nClinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president.

Chris Christie surfaced once again in the national news this week, floated by some as a possible new entrant in the ever-widening, fickle field of Republican presidential contenders.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Christie got even more attention on his own by heading straight to the \"Jersey Shore\" -- the TV show.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Christie vetoed a $420,000 tax break previously granted to MTV's most popular program -- the highly viewed and just as highly derided reality series featuring Snooki, The Situation and other often inebriated free-range narcissists. In denying the show's producers the New Jersey Economic Development Authority's 20% tax credit on TV shows filmed or produced in the state, Christie said it was unjustifiable \"for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLike a rain-slicked Atlantic City boardwalk as it snakes its way to the shore, that's some slippery ground on which Christie is treading.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's difficult, maybe even impossible, to disagree with him on the position of being anti-\"Jersey Shore\": Anything that slows the spread of that video virus is, almost by definition, a good thing. But what if the same logic and political tactics had been used on, say, HBO's \"The Sopranos\"? Even if that sort of concern amounts to fiscal responsibility, it also amounts to artistic irresponsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoliticians have attacked TV before, but the attention they draw rarely has them getting the last word, or being awarded the final victory. Dan Quayle vs. \"Murphy Brown\"? The CBS sitcom won that one, handily; the single mother about whom Quayle was so upset was, after all, a fictional TV character.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, in 1992, campaigned by promising to make American families \"a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" Bart, one of the animated characters on \"The Simpsons,\" retaliated almost instantly in a quickly dubbed opening credits sequence, replying, \"We're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChristie, by pulling the state purse strings tighter and refusing to hand over rebate tax credit money to TV productions that make New Jersey look bad, is wielding a heavy club. Where else, after all, could \"Jersey Shore\" film its reality-show escapades? Italy? (Actually, yes. They've done just that. But MTV and \"Jersey Shore\" haven't yet gone to the original Jersey shore, nestled in the English Channel and part of the United Kingdom. Maybe next year.)\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe, if CW's \"H8R\" lasts another season (which is doubtful), Christie could come on as a Snooki \"hater,\" as a nonfan did to confront the \"Jersey Shore\" standout star in this month's season premiere, and take away her show's tax credits on camera.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut really, the biggest media storm he could generate here, and the one that would score him even stronger political points, would be to make the tax credits, or the denial of them, qualitative as well as quantitative, and thus support the arts in the most measurable way possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nBear with me here: Christie could make it a policy to give tax rebates for the quality shows, and levy fines -- tackiness taxes, if you will -- for those that besmirch New Jersey in particular and the lively arts in general.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake good TV and movies, you get money back. Make bad TV and movies, you pay a surcharge.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder such a system, the better the TV show or movie, the higher the tax incentives.

It spurred two sequels, theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was followed by films like \"A Bug's Life,\" \"Monster's Inc.,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"The Incredibles,\" the last two of which won Academy Awards for best animated feature.

He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run.\n\n\n\nDarrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47.\n\n\n\nMore charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system.\n\n\n\nAlumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an \"associate\" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released.\n\n\n\nThe alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said.\n\n\n\nMohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement.\n\n\n\nLay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children.\n\n\n\nMohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but \"his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\nSome lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth.\n\n\n\nThe Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n\nInvestigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday. He declined to comment on any evidence found.\n\n\n\nCNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.", "qas": [{"question": "Who were arrested Tuesday?", "id": "091ce4b419e4483888c050e9b7e4d26d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1771, "text": "Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A.

A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar recently called the allegations of MMS corruption \"evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of [the agency] and the oil and gas industry.\"  He pledged to follow through with the Interior Department inspector general's recommendations, \"including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSalazar insisted Thursday in testimony before a House subcommittee, however, that Birnbaum had resigned \"on her own terms and own volition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe \"is a strong and very effective person who, among other things, helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do,\" Salazar said. \"She helped us with addressing a very broken system. And all I can really [say] is that she is a good public servant.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMMS collected nearly $10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009.

That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts valued  at more than $6,600 from an offshore drilling contractor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the growing push to crack down on the MMS, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, introduced legislation Wednesday requiring federal oil industry regulators to wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies.

Myers. A staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, he was killed in a roadside bombing in Afghanistan on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe body of Phillip Myers, 30, arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe return of his body to the United States aboard a charter aircraft Sunday marked a solemn moment that has been repeated more than 5,000 times at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware since the start of the war in Afghanistan in late 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of this night was like so many of the others: The well-practiced and crisp movement of the carry team silently transferring the body from the plane to the truck that would transport it to the base mortuary and the presence of Myers' family, quietly watching every step and order, ensured dignity and respect for the fallen in an atmosphere that does not lend itself to peace and quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis night, however, was not like the other nights. Watching all of this were about 40 journalists allowed to cover the return of Myers' remains. It was the first time in almost 20 years the return of a fallen U.S. service member was able to be recorded by the media.\n\n\n\n\n\nMyers' widow was the first to be asked by the military, under a new policy by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, if she wished to have news media at Dover Air Force Base for her husband's final return home. Her decision to do so was historical and allowed the public to see a side of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq the country has not yet seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only noise on the flight line was the perpetual whine of the Atlas Air 747's power generator. This was the plane that had brought Myers and another fallen soldier back to the United States. The media were not allowed to cover the other soldier's transfer and were not given his name or the circumstances of his death, because the family had not granted permission.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flight line, journalists were asked not to speak, use camera flashes or make undue movement while watching the transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith cameras rolling, an eight-member carry team wearing battle-dress uniforms and white gloves stood by the flag-draped transfer case carrying Myers, as the chaplain, Maj. Klabens Noel, said a prayer.  Watch the coverage of the return of the fallen service member \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team slowly moved the transfer case from the aircraft onto the loader. With a jolt, the quiet of the night was shattered as a diesel engine was started to lower the loader toward the ground and then was shut off.\n\n\n\n\n\nBathed in light from the giant floodlights along the flight line, the team hoisted the transfer case and carried it to a waiting panel truck.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the transfer case was secured, the carry team saluted, the doors of the truck were slowly closed and then driven under police escort to the base mortuary.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven family members watched the truck until it was out of sight, one man among them crying into a tissue.\n\n\n\n\n\nMyers was from Hopewell, Virginia, and died Saturday of wounds suffered in a roadside bombing, the Air Force said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was assigned to the 48th Civil Engineer Squadron, with the Royal Air Force Lakenheath, UK, and in March 2008 received the Bronze Star for valor. He was 30 years old. Casualties: Afghanistan | Iraq\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban on media coverage of returning war dead was implemented by President George Bush in 1991 and the policy has been the subject of much debate since. Some called it censorship; others said it allowed privacy and respect for the families during a very difficult time.  Watch an Army widow call the policy is 'dignified' \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nAn exception on the ban by President Bill Clinton in 2000 allowed coverage of the return of sailors killed in the attack on the USS Cole.\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after taking office, President Obama asked Gates to take a look at the policy. In February, Gates reversed it, but with conditions. Family members would be asked if they wanted news media to cover the transfer of their loved one's body.

Brown was also won over by the neighborhood with its tidy homes and good school district. \"I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district.\"\n\n\n\nBut they hardly had a chance. Instead, fighting back tears, she says, \"I have to get out.\"\n\n\n\nBrown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure. The house was recently sold at auction.\n\n\n\nThe bad news came just seven months after Brown had moved in.

According to the Center for Housing Policy, nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal.   In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what's going on, renters are usually kept in the dark.\n\n\n\nNew York State Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems. \"In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money,\" he says.\n\n\n\nKlein says rental properties are involved in 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York, and he is working on a law to warn renters of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time and to keep them from losing their security deposit and being evicted with nowhere to go.\n\n\n\nSimilar laws are already in place in Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Maryland, Rhode Island, Michigan and California. \"What we're facing here\", Klein says, \"is sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it.\"\n\n\n\nBrown was astonished to learn that her landlord rented her the house when she knew she was losing it. \"She knew that this house was foreclosing on her.

DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nThe \"belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,\" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\n\n\"It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines.

The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups.

The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter.\n\n\n\nBased on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law.

They are co-chairs of the Genocide Prevention Task Force.\n\n\n\nMadeleine K. Albright served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\n(CNN) -- In this age of electronic media communications, Americans are increasingly confronted in their living rooms -- and even on their cell phones -- with information about and images of genocide and mass atrocities virtually anywhere they occur.\n\n\n\nThis instantaneous media communication has sensitized many Americans to the suffering of people in all corners of the globe. The Internet has proved to be a powerful tool for organizing broad-based responses to genocide and mass atrocities, as we have seen in response to the crisis in Darfur.\n\n\n\nWith all of this information written and broadcast about the horrors of genocide and mass atrocities around the world, why do they continue? And as public citizens, public officials and policymakers, how can we prevent this horrendous crime that assaults our humanitarian values and threatens our national security?\n\n\n\nLast year, we agreed to co-chair the Genocide Prevention Task Force, which was jointly convened by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, The American Academy of Diplomacy and the United States Institute of Peace. (The final report is to be released next week.)\n\n\n\nThe idea for the task force arose out of a desire by each of these institutions to reach beyond their individual capabilities and build a practical framework that could help the U.S. government better respond to threats of genocide and mass atrocities. Our challenge was to match words to deeds and stop allowing the unacceptable. That task is in fact one of the most persistent puzzles of our times.\n\n\n\nMany people ask: Why do genocides and mass atrocities happen?\n\n\n\nThere is no consensus as to the causes of genocide and mass atrocities, nor is there one commonly agreed-upon theory that explains the key catalysts, motivations or mechanisms that lead to them. History has shown that genocide and mass atrocities manifest themselves in highly variable ways, and we should not assume that future perpetrators will follow old patterns.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are warning signs. Genocide is not the inevitable result of \"ancient hatreds\" or irrational leaders. It requires planning and is carried out systematically. But that fact also means that there are ways to recognize its signs and symptoms, and viable options to prevent it at every turn, if we are committed and prepared.\n\n\n\nOur report recommends a number of distinct but interrelated areas where the United States government can develop and deploy more effective strategies to identify and pursue opportunities for prevention of genocide and mass atrocities:\n\n\n\nFirst, we believe that leadership is an indispensable ingredient. Nothing is more central to preventing genocide than leadership -- from the president, Congress and the American people. Making progress requires leaders to summon political will not only after a crisis strikes, but also before one emerges.\n\n\n\nSecond is the importance of early warning. It is critical for policymakers to have good analysis of areas where there is a high risk of genocide or organized violence in order to design effective strategies and spur action. By improving the accuracy of warnings, we will find greater opportunities for preventive action.\n\n\n\nEarly prevention can avert a crisis. Many countries are vulnerable to extreme violence. By engaging leaders, institutions and civil society at an early stage, the United States can help countries steer clear of these dangers.\n\n\n\nPreventive diplomacy is critical to halt and reverse escalation. Even when signs of preparation for genocide are apparent, there are opportunities to alter leaders' decisions and interrupt their plans. By improving our crisis response system, we will be better prepared to mount coherent, carefully calibrated and timely preventive diplomatic strategies.\n\n\n\nA willingness to utilize military options to stop ongoing atrocities when prevention efforts have failed is crucial. U.S. military assets can also play an important role in supporting and providing credibility to options short of the use of force, including by deterring violence through military presence or threat.\n\n\n\nLastly, we cite the power of international action.

The administration said the economy was growing at a faster rate than the emissions themselves.\n\n\n\nWhile the White House has taken heat for its environmental policies -- including from some Republicans such as Sen. John McCain -- Bush said at the conference Friday, \"By working together, we will set wise and effective policies.\"\n\n\n\nHe added, \"I want to get the job done.

Sounds predictable, right? But weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, can be volatile and dangerous.\n\n\n\nAir France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa.\n\n\n\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone, which circles the Earth near the equator, is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane's crash, the tragedy does call attention to the region.\n\n\n\nThe ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator. On the flip side, air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere. The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as \"trade winds\" and converge in the middle of the tropics. That's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from.\n\n\n\nHere, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph.\n\n\n\nThe height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ.\n\n\n\nFormer Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane's disappearance on his Web site, weathergraphics.com.\n\n\n\n\"Based on the infrared satellite imagery, I was able to. . .estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet,\" he told CNN in a phone interview.\n\n\n\nVasquez himself has flown through the ITCZ at least half a dozen times.\n\n\n\n\"I remember flying from Guam to the Philippines, constantly weaving around the thunderstorms. Sometimes, though, pilots are forced to fly through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThat's because commercial airliners cannot fly above 50,000 feet. In addition, ITCZ thunderstorms can merge with one another to stretch far and wide, covering hundreds of miles.\n\n\n\nThe crew of Air France Flight 447 reported severe turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared.  How did the plane break into pieces? \u00bb\n\n\n\nWhen it's not storming in the ITCZ, the weather can be completely calm, with little to no wind. This stretch of ocean was particularly dreaded by sailors of the 19th century, who named it \"The Doldrums,\" because its lack of wind could leave them stuck at sea, unable to propel forward.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges and dangers, planes and ships successfully cross the ITZC every day, thanks in part to technology that has made it easier to see where the thunderstorms are.\n\n\n\nHere are some commonly asked questions:\n\n\n\nCan hurricanes form in the ITCZ?\n\n\n\nIt's extremely rare for a hurricane to form near the equator. However, the ITCZ doesn't stay in one place all year long. In the summer, for example, it drifts more northward, where it's possible for tropical cyclones to develop from the thunderstorms there.\n\n\n\nWhat does the ITCZ have to do with the \"monsoon season\" in Asia?\n\n\n\nSince the position of the ITCZ fluctuates, the location of the heaviest rainfalls varies depending on the time of year. When the zone drifts more northward in May and June, it brings the rainy season to places like Southeast Asia and India. The term \"monsoon\" refers to a seasonal reversal of winds.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the weather like in the ITCZ?", "id": "11a57027e3ff46fb8465d96bd0fbb6fe", "answers": [{"answer_start": 219, "text": "volatile"}]}, {"question": "Where did the plane crash?", "id": "1b9f87a19463462dac00774f0c77eb01", "answers": [{"answer_start": 283, "text": "volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa."}]}, {"question": "Which airlines plane was involved?", "id": "7c74487fc1c943879ac66dda1e03d85f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 246, "text": "Air France"}]}, {"question": "Where is the ITCZ?", "id": "6ac3aadc635c40e1a687524905e7cef0", "answers": [{"answer_start": 412, "text": "near the equator,"}]}, {"question": "Where did the Air France plane go down?", "id": "5b4a540c8adf40a181b5fd70e898fad2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 297, "text": "along the equator between South America and Africa."}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the airline?", "id": "a73d6910ac6346e2a8251edac9754aca", "answers": [{"answer_start": 246, "text": "Air France"}]}, {"question": "Where is the zone located?", "id": "5a0112def1ba44d2b4b535e772a43041", "answers": [{"answer_start": 352, "text": "The Intertropical Convergence"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Editor's note: With fears of a swine flu pandemic ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Editor's note: With fears of a swine flu pandemic rising daily, CNN Pentagon producer Larry Shaughnessy remembered a batch of letters from his grandfather, a World War I soldier who battled the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin \"Al\" Culhane, left, is pictured with his older brother, Frank, around 1918 or 1919.\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN)  -- \"I'm coming, I'm coming For my head is bending low I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs World War I rages in Europe, fresh U.S. Army soldiers pass the time on a train ride to to Camp Forrest, Georgia. \"The boys are just starting to sing,\" Martin Aloysius Culhane wrote on September 6, 1918, to his friend back home. \"They've gotten back to 'Old Black Joe' so far.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Foster's classic song from the Civil War is about the death of slaves who had become his friends.

And his Japanese ex-wife -- a fugitive in the United States for taking his children from Tennessee -- is considered the victim.\n\n\n\n\"Japan is an important partner and friend of the U.S., but on this issue, our points of view differ,\" the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said Tuesday. \"Our two nations approach divorce and child-rearing differently. Parental child abduction is not considered a crime in Japan.\"\n\n\n\nThe story begins in the Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tennessee, with the January divorce of Savoie from his first wife, Noriko, a Japanese native. The ex-wife had agreed to live in Franklin to be close to the children, taking them to Japan for summer vacations.\n\n\n\nSavoie in March requested a restraining order to prevent his ex-wife from taking the children to Japan, saying she had threatened to do so, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate WTVF and posted on the station's Web site. A temporary order was issued, but then lifted following a hearing.\n\n\n\n\"If Mother fails to return to Tennessee [after summer vacation] with the children following her visitation period, she could lose her alimony, child support and education fund, which is added assurance to Father that she is going to return with the children,\" Circuit Court Judge James G. Martin III noted in his order on the matter.\n\n\n\nAfter that ruling, Christopher Savoie tried to have Martin recuse himself, as he was a mediator in the case prior to becoming a judge, said Marlene Eskind Moses, Noriko Savoie's attorney. But that request was denied, as Savoie earlier said he had no concerns about Martin hearing the matter.\n\n\n\nFollowing the summer trip, Noriko Savoie did return to the United States, and Christopher Savoie then took the children on a vacation, returning them to his ex-wife, his attorney, Paul Bruno, told CNN.  Watch latest report on Savoie's situation \u00bb\n\n\n\nBut days later, on the first day of classes for 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca, the school called Savoie to say his children hadn't arrived, Bruno said. Police checked Noriko Savoie's home and did not find the children.\n\n\n\nConcerned, Savoie called his ex-wife's father in Japan, who told him not to worry.\n\n\n\n\"I said, 'What do you mean -- don't worry? They weren't at school.' 'Oh, don't worry, they are here,' \" Savoie recounted the conversation to CNN affiliate WTVF earlier this month. \"I said, 'They are what, they are what, they are in Japan?' \"\n\n\n\nThe very thing that Savoie had predicted in court papers had happened -- his wife had taken their children to Japan and showed no signs of returning, Bruno said.\n\n\n\nAfter Noriko Savoie took the children to Japan, Savoie filed for and received full custody of the children, Bruno said. And Franklin police issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife, the television station reported.\n\n\n\nBut there was a major hitch: Japan is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on international child abduction. The international agreement standardizes laws, but only among participating countries.\n\n\n\nSo while Japanese civil law stresses that courts resolve custody issues based on the best interest of the children without regard to either parent's nationality, foreign parents have had little success in regaining custody.\n\n\n\nJapanese family law follows a tradition of sole custody divorces.

It's not rush-rush-rush.\n\n\n\nI think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty.\n\n\n\nIn five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful.\n\n\n\nCNN: What was your childhood like?\n\n\n\nPetra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood ... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless.\n\n\n\nWe didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature.\n\n\n\nAnd the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit.

Her attorney, Gloria Allred, employs her studied grimace as Sharon Bialek tells of an encounter 14 years ago that, if true, constitutes an unreported sexual assault. At his own press conference the next day, candidate Cain issues a heated denial, having earlier hinted at a willingness to take a lie detector test.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would the court system, America's formal arbiter of truth, evaluate the competing claims?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe courts would refuse to even consider them. In the legal world, courts scrupulously enforce statutes of limitations on accusations of improper or criminal conduct. The rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage. Witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder. The law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Herman Cain now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom. Cain must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired. Unfortunately, finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety. Glass-walled office suites are the norm, insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view. The world of \"Mad Men's\" Don Draper and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past. Today's sexual harassment is far more subtle.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough legitimate claims deserve compensation, the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside. False complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with CEO clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment. They want their reputations and integrity preserved. But when a high-ranking executive is involved, the company rumor vine begins to grow. Depositions are taken. Employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other. Sterling reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, the litigation process is expensive for the company. Knowing this, experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit. Legitimate victims are also urged to settle rather than risk losing at trial.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce mediation begins, the parties are told that public humiliation and legal costs can be avoided with a quiet, confidential settlement. Both plaintiff and defendant are simultaneously silenced by the agreement's penalty provisions. The truth of the claims will never be tested in any public forum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, unless the accused decides to run for public office. Then it appears the art of the leak can undermine the solidity of even the most carefully drafted of confidentiality agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\nHerman Cain said he never consented to the mediation process. The National Restaurant Association, through its board, might have negotiated its own deal with the two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Cain to avoid bad publicity and legal costs. Businesses will often \"settle and seal\" the case rather than endure the expense and embarrassment of defending even a falsely accused chief executive.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the sketchy reported accounts, the initial case against Cain might have been paper-thin. There is no assertion of overt sexual contact between him and the female employees in question. The website Politico, which broke the story, refers to witness accounts of episodes of conversations filled with \"innuendo\" and of \"physical gestures that were not overtly sexual\" but which made female employees feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo one who has followed Cain", "qas": [{"question": "Did the court hear the cases?", "id": "cbf8dbab5324461592f31283f4beb63c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 562, "text": "would refuse to even consider them."}]}, {"question": "who were the women accusing?", "id": "c432211d434a4182823641e78e5cbadf", "answers": [{"answer_start": 49, "text": "Herman Cain,"}]}, {"question": "what claims are often settled out of court?", "id": "d248197351dc49c69e5a91d0820211bb", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1150, "text": "sexual harassment"}]}, {"question": "who is accusing Cain?", "id": "0a60524d20f34373bc8dd3389afaab6d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 192, "text": "Sharon Bialek"}]}]}]}, {"title": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Harrison's", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Harrison's closest friends and family gathered in Hollywood on Tuesday to dedicate the late Beatle's star on the Walk of Fame.\n\nFrom left, musicians Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Paul McCartney join Harrison's relatives for dedication of his star.\n\n\"There's someone here from every important stage of George's life and career,\" Harrison's widow, Olivia, said.\n\nHarrison, who was 58 when he died of cancer in 2001, becomes the second Beatle with a Hollywood star.

It was presented to him the night he broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played.\n\n\n\nRipken was a \"rookie\" for the second time in his life, this time in business. \"I was learning all over again, learning what was important,\" he said. \"The off-season never went by so fast. I had meetings, phone calls, plans and long days in the office.\n\n\n\n\"By the time I looked up, [the Orioles] were at spring training. I didn't think, 'They left without me,' which is what I thought I would do.\"\n\n\n\nRipken's latest project is a business principles book called \"Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference,\" co-authored by Donald T. Phillips.\n\n\n\nThe book, available April 10, was born out a speech Ripken gave about the \"secrets\" of his success. Writing it turned out to be an emotional journey, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I got to reflect on what my parents had taught me, the values and principles, right and wrong,\" Ripken said. \"It's good to be in touch with those things.\"\n\n\n\nThe fact is, whether in baseball or business, Ripken rarely strays from the principles he learned from his late father, Cal Sr., a former player and manager. The book is filled with anecdotes from on and off the field.\n\n\n\nNow 46, Ripken is president and CEO of Ripken Baseball, and his brother, Bill, a former teammate, is executive vice president.

Chip Cravaack, R-Minnesota, requires the Transportation Security Administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families, when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders.\n\n\n\n\n\nCravaack, a 24-year Navy veteran and former Northwest Airlines pilot, was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country,\" said the congressman's spokesman, Michael Bars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in North Carolina and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to court records, Trey Scott Atwater, a 30-year-old Army Green Beret, had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve headed for Texas. He was allowed to continue on his trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. Authorities said Atwater did not have a detonator and initiator, that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives, and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like Atwater's. Bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening, but not reduce security. Currently, the TSA expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them, and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members. The TSA was starting to tests its ability to scan military ID cards, known as \"Common Access Cards,\" at a regional airport in Monterey, CA.\n\n\n\n\n\nPistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. But if tests are successful, \"we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel, the TSA will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk.\"", "qas": [{"question": "When do President obama sign the Bill?", "id": "c580289b1a2d49aa86268e2b1aa1090f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 123, "text": "Tuesday"}]}, {"question": "who signed the law?", "id": "eb9d02063e8a42ca8b34b7d82d4c4189", "answers": [{"answer_start": 134, "text": "President Obama."}]}, {"question": "what is going to study the TSA?", "id": "9d68b266ae434abb9d73cd2def6f8201", "answers": [{"answer_start": 271, "text": "ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families,"}]}, {"question": "What the new law required?", "id": "f2512611b47d4f24bf38225a97ff0bc6", "answers": [{"answer_start": 219, "text": "the Transportation Security Administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of militants", "paragraphs": [{"context": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of militants, believed to be foreign fighters, launched attacks on various military check posts in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan Saturday night and early Sunday morning, military officials said.\n\n\n\nA Pakistan soldier on patrol last fall against militants on the border of the Mohmand agency district.\n\n\n\nThe ensuing fighting left 40 militants and six Pakistan soldiers dead, said military spokesman Gen.

Peter W. Chiarelli, vice chief of staff of the Army, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it is the cumulative effect of deployments from 12 to 15 months,\" he said, adding that the longer deployments are scheduled to continue until June.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited long deployments, lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdm. Patrick M. Walsh, vice chief of naval operations, said suicides are the third leading cause of death in the Navy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We must eliminate the perceived stigma, shame and dishonor of asking for help,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGen. James F. Amos, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, said his branch of the service has incorporated education and training about suicide prevention \"at all levels.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said four of 55 mental health professionals deployed in the U.S. Central Command were recently embedded with Marines. He expressed optimism that that tactic would pay off, but he said he had no data to support his expectation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Gen. William M. Fraser, vice chief of staff of the Air Force, said his branch, too, was taking steps \"to ensure airmen are as mentally prepared for deployment and redeployment as they are physically and professionally.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the efforts have not sufficed. He noted that last year, for the first time, the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population. \"What's going on?\" he asked rhetorically.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe panel members made clear that, whatever is going on, it is complex. Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones. At least 70 percent of the suicides had \"some kind of relationship problem,\" he said. Often, the situation was worsened by something else, such as a financial or legal problem, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it wasn't just the trauma of war that appears to heighten the risk. The suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment, those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed, Chiarelli said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the military leaders said they had too few mental health professionals in their ranks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Walsh said professionals are not the only people who must be trained to intervene, noting that it is often the shipmate or the battle buddy who seeks assistance for someone in need.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Navy counselors are now asking family members for feedback that often proves more illuminating than what the sailors themselves are willing to impart, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I survey the family, I'm going to get a different set of answers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason some service personnel are reluctant to seek help from their chain of command is because they fear they will then be passed over for promotions, the panel members said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, they pay out of their own pockets to seek help privately, Rubenstein said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd others call civilian hotlines, one of which reported getting three calls per day this year from active-duty military personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentatives of all of the branches of the military said they have seen recent increases in suicides.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Gates said he believes the 15-month deployments \"were a real strain\" on many, but expressed optimism that beneficial changes are in the works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the services are are addressing this problem, but the Army in particular, I think, is really going after it in a very aggressive way,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some suicides appear to defy all prevention efforts.

An unusual aspect of the show was that traditional Detroit nameplates such as General Motors sat next to competitors from other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event was organized by Bright Automotive, a small carmaker from Anderson, Indiana, to showcase its IDEA, a new, 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets. In a statement, the company said it has applied for funding through the federal Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display, in a parking lot near the Russell Senate Office Building.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Bush administration, Japanese automakers complained they weren't invited to a similar demonstration near the Treasury Department, despite having brought their alternative-energy cars more swiftly to the U.S. market than the Detroit automakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a General Motors product spokesman at Tuesday's display. \"If anything, it's just a little bit of noise in the background,\" said Tony Posawatz, a GM vehicle line director.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told CNN the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of Volt electric cars expected to come to market by November 2010. A silver GM sedan on display nearby uses electric batteries and a self-contained recharging engine powered by a variety of fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would like people to stop talking mpg,\" Posawatz said, leading a reporter toward a van powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The Chevy Equinox on display is one of 100 now in private hands. Instead of miles per gallon, the energy plant supplies electricity and a calculation of cruising range while driving.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, however, drivers might still be impressed by the ZENN, a little car claiming 280 miles per gallon. The car's cruising range of about 40 miles translates to about 280 miles per gallon, according to the Canadian automaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ZENN\" stands for Zero Emission No Noise, said a worker who was buffing away some tree pollen that had settled on the car during the breezy afternoon. The car's top speed is about that of a strong gust of wind -- 35 mph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's supposed to be your third car in the driveway,\" explained ZENN spokesman Daniel Stiller. \"Most people drive less than 20 miles from home on streets with speed limits of 35 miles per hour or less.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe acknowledged that the car may qualify as street-legal only on local, low-speed roads.

Actually, it was available for '06-'07 as both a TL and a higher-end TL Type S -- the latter of which sported an upgraded engine, a 286-hp 3.5-liter.

His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends.\n\n\n\n\n\nTestimony from nurse Cherilyn Lee's was interrupted for 25 minutes Tuesday as she was overcome with emotion. \"I'm feeling really, really dizzy,\" Lee said. \"This is just very sensitive to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee and a Los Angeles doctor, both called as defense witnesses, testified that Jackson asked them for drugs to help him sleep in April 2009.

Sure, sometimes it's hard to get into the college of your choice, but the schools are fighting just as hard to lure in top applicants.\n\n\n\nDavidson college students don't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free laundry service.\n\n\n\nWhile some colleges boast about class sizes, graduate fellowships, and endowment growth rates, this sort of info is likely to bore the 17-year-old students they're wooing. Instead, some schools try to come up with unique perks that appeal to students, often in the form of free services.\n\n\n\nWhile the cost of these \"free\" perks is undoubtedly built back into tuition bills, when a family's spending upwards of $40,000 a year for school, it can't hurt to help them feel like they're getting something for nothing. Here are a few you might be jealous of:\n\n\n\n1. Free laundry\n\n\n\nNothing's more maddening for a college student than wanting to study, party, or sleep, only to be confronted with a massive mound of laundry. Most of us know that if left unchecked, these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they're on the brink of becoming sentient beings, but students at Davidson, an elite liberal arts college in North Carolina, don't have to worry about it. Their college does the laundry for them.\n\n\n\nSince 1919, Davidson has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets. At the Lula Bell Houston Laundry, students' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them.\n\n\n\nThe laundry clears about six tons' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week, but if students prefer to keep their filthy T-shirts to themselves, the school also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms.\n\n\n\nAs if that's not enough, Davidson was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the NCAA's Sweet 16 last March. The school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in Detroit, two nights' lodging, and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their Cinderella in person. Mental Floss: 8 tuition-free colleges\n\n\n\n2. Free skiing\n\n\n\nMichigan Technological University offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students, but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants. The school owns Mont Ripley, a ski slope on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. While normal lift-ticket prices run at around $35 a day, Michigan Tech students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime.\n\n\n\n3. Free computers\n\n\n\nAt my undergrad alma mater, Wake Forest, one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation, the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer. Students keep this laptop for two years, then trade it in for a new model before their junior year. Students then take this one with them when they graduate.\n\n\n\nWhile there was a downside to the system (if profs know everyone has a laptop, they're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class), it really upped the on-campus computing efficiency. Any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop, and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines, tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly.

Free theater tickets\n\n\n\nNothing irks actors and theater owners quite so much as playing to an empty house, so if tickets are moving slowly, why not fill the seats with college students? NYU's Ticket Central can wrangle Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for up to 75 percent off their face values, but sometimes, the school can get lucky students into theaters for free to help fill otherwise thin crowds.\n\n\n\nTicket Central also boasts that it can get students into Knicks games for as ", "qas": [{"question": "What is used to lure students?", "id": "144ba08c90054d9f864538e8113ac853", "answers": [{"answer_start": 621, "text": "free services."}]}, {"question": "Do students at Davidson College pay for laundry?", "id": "fb1c311b507c464b903c7b32210e9319", "answers": [{"answer_start": 256, "text": "don't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free"}]}, {"question": "What is given out for free at some colleges?", "id": "8238f44246824f5f8bce4ace866087d8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 328, "text": "laundry service."}]}, {"question": "Which ones have free laundry?", "id": "9b4be388317541d6b4d43c9efdc0a094", "answers": [{"answer_start": 230, "text": "Davidson college students"}]}, {"question": "What lures students to colleges?", "id": "e266e50c7eb94d938f889f8e66aa10c8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 621, "text": "free services."}]}, {"question": "Where can I get a free computer?", "id": "91cdd493d501438c868c9f4a43ea3f06", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2668, "text": "Wake Forest,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- Adidas, the brand loved for its sports ge", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Adidas, the brand loved for its sports gear, might be expanding into fashion but it won't desert its fitness loving fans, the chief executive says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdidas is now working with top designers, such as Stella McCartney, to create a distinctive genre of sportswear and lifestyle fashion products.

He said he looked in on her at 10 a.m. and saw her lying on her bed, but figured she was sleeping in, which wasn't unusual, the court heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorris said he realized something was wrong when he checked in again at 3 p.m. and saw Winehouse had not moved. She wasn't breathing and had no pulse, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorris said the singer didn't \"drink to get drunk,\" but that he noticed she had started drinking alcohol again that week.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice who searched the flat after her death found three empty vodka bottles, the inquest heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pathologist's tests revealed that Winehouse's blood-alcohol level was 416 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood. The level considered lethal is 350 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, and the legal limit to drive in Britain is 80 milligrams of alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pathologist found no traces of tablets in Winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe verdict of misadventure means that it is judged to be an accidental death in which no law was broken or criminal negligence involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nA family statement, given by spokesman Chris Goodman, said: \"It is (with) some relief we finally found out what happened to Amy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We understand there was alcohol in her system when she passed away. It is likely a buildup of alcohol in her system over a number of days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The court heard that Amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time. She had started drinking again that week after a period of abstinence,\" Goodman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWinehouse's father Mitch and mother Janet were among those who packed the small courtroom at St. Pancras Coroners Court to hear the evidence from key witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer family set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation last month to raise money to help young people in Britain and elsewhere, especially those suffering the effects of ill health, disability, poverty and addiction.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodman said the ruling \"underlines how important our work with the Amy Winehouse Foundation is to us to help as many young people and children we can in her name.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWinehouse's family said in August that toxicology tests had found that \"no illegal substances\" were in her system at the time of her death but alcohol was present.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe singer's soulful, throaty vocals brought her stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her top 10 hit \"Rehab\" -- won her notoriety.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tattooed London-born singer-songwriter's first album, \"Frank,\" debuted in 2003, when she was 19.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational success ", "qas": [{"question": "Who recounted details of Winehouse's last hours?", "id": "b999b0cedcd1447b822ddccf34cabec4", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1185, "text": "Andrew Morris,"}]}, {"question": "What age was Winehouse when she died?", "id": "cbb53f49dd5746a19dc95b2ac047a687", "answers": [{"answer_start": 275, "text": "27-year-old's"}]}, {"question": "How many vodka bottles were found?", "id": "8fd0fb454968435f93da377bce88d65c", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1737, "text": "three"}]}, {"question": "who talked about her last hours", "id": "558dea0334cf4e81ab5f22365e79ab5b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1185, "text": "Andrew Morris,"}]}, {"question": "What age was the person who died?", "id": "7d83d818f3ba4db19f40eb155fd6e616", "answers": [{"answer_start": 275, "text": "27-year-old's"}]}, {"question": "What was found in Winehouse's home?", "id": "a103fee179d24e01afac355e24433e16", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1737, "text": "three empty vodka bottles,"}]}, {"question": "When did she die?", "id": "f3edccdb629a473aa46b74b5be302b9b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 530, "text": "July 23."}]}, {"question": "what was found at winehouse's home", "id": "a9e037717c1240859e5593a0a6586ffa", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1737, "text": "three empty vodka bottles,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tuba Sahaab looks not", "paragraphs": [{"context": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tuba Sahaab looks nothing like a warrior.

Others describe the poet's gratitude for his mother. Some are very short. Some are very long.\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes the mother-child relationship is complicated and the poet discusses the good times along with the bad. Other times, it's a straightforward message of love and gratitude. If nothing else, the poet almost always acknowledges the significant role a mother plays in the lives of her children.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeedless-to-say, with Mom being portrayed so many different ways in poetry, there are several avenues for approaching a selection of poems appropriate for Mother's Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, we're here to help you.

It appeared \"A Child's Garden of Verses,\" a collection of 65 poems by Stevenson first published in 1885 under the title \"Penny Whistles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYou too, my mother, read my rhymes For love of unforgotten times, And you may chance to hear once more The little feet along the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kaddish\" by Allen Ginsberg\n\n\n\n\n\nGinsberg, one of the leading voices of the Beat Generation, wrote this lengthy poem following the 1956 death of his mother. It was published as part of a collection, \"Kaddish and Other Poems: 1958-1960.\" Its title refers to the traditional Jewish prayer recited during times of mourning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To My Mother\" by Christina Rosetti\n\n\n\n\n\nRosetti, a 19th century English poet best known for her lengthy poem called \"Goblin's Market,\" wrote this short piece about her mother in 1842:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo-day's your natal day; Sweet flowers I bring: Mother, accept, I pray My offering. And may you happy live, And long us bless; Receiving as you give Great happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Nature Network: Kids' Mother's Day crafts projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thanking My Mother for Piano Lessons\" by Diane Wakoski\n\n\n\n\n\nWakoski, a contemporary poet who counts Allen Ginsberg among her influences, writes of the \"beauty that can come from even an ugly past\" in this poem that recounts, among other things, the financial struggles her mother accepted in order to make sure she could pay for her child's piano lessons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mother o' Mine\" by Rudyard Kipling\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nobel laureate, who lived from 1865 to 1936, wrote about the undying love of a mother in this 11-line poem:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I were hanged on the highest hill, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! I know whose love would follow me still, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! If I were drowned in the deepest sea, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! I know whose tears would come down to me, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! If I were damned of body and soul, I know whose prayers would make me whole, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mother to Son\" by Langston Hughes\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lesser-known piece by the Harlem Renaissance writer takes the perspective of the mother speaking to her son and telling him that \"Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.\" It can be found in \"The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I Learned From My Mother\" by Julia Kasdorf\n\n\n\n\n\nKasdorf is the second contemporary poet on our list.

They think they're so great with all their fancy book learning.\n\n\n\nWhat they don't realize is that TV isn't for dummies -- there's tons of educational programming available -- you just need to know what to watch. I mean, you can learn your ABCs with \"Sesame Street's\" Grover, how to make gnocchi with Mario Batali, and the ins and outs of prettying up your home with any number of programs on HGTV.\n\n\n\nTelevision is also a great romance resource. Think of all the great TV twosomes we've seen over the years -- Lucy & Ricky Ricardo, Judy & George Jetson, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag ... but not all TV personalities set such a sincerely loving example. It's also a good place to learn which type of guy you should avoid.\n\n\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n\n\nChuck Bass (\"Gossip Girl\"): Few men can pull off lavender argyle, but Chuck Bass is definitely one of them. Moody and sinister, when Chuck Bass Types (CBTs) like you, it's as though you've been inducted into a secret society of two.\n\n\n\nIt's you against the world and the CBT will bring out a dark side you might not have even realized you possessed. Whip smart with a caustic wit, he'll charm you all the while tucking away your secrets for use at a later date. And use them he will. Because when a CBT tires of you, he won't just say \"see ya,\" he'll decimate you.\n\n\n\nHank Moody (\"Californication\"): Some boys take longer than usual to grow out of their Charles Bukowski-wannabe phase. Exhibit A is Hank Moody. Actor David Duchovny, playing what the tabloids would have you believe is an autobiographical role, has managed to hang onto his Bukowski-phase well into his forties. Drinking, partying, and resisting monogamy, Hank still manages to attract more ladies than hotter men half his age.\n\n\n\nOf course the only women drawn to Hank are either damaged girls with daddy issues or the type of dame who doesn't feel complete unless she has some mess to clean up after. If you see yourself dating a Hank Moody type, do not walk -- run -- to your nearest mental health professional.\n\n\n\nVince Chase (\"Entourage\"): Those big blue eyes and that floppy mop o' hair...  you can forgive him for making a stinker like \"Medellin,\" can't you? Sure, but do you really want to deal with someone who lives in a dude cocoon? Not only does he live with his brother and two best friends, he can't make any decisions without polling the group.\n\n\n\nOn the upside, he's rich! On the downside, he's famous, which means other women are throwing themselves at him constantly.

They say that for most people, the payouts are modest.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much money residents get depends on how much property they own and how much gas -- if any -- is found.

Nonetheless, the movie's $55.7 million take (including $5.5 million from 124 IMAX screens) is substantially smaller than the $70.9 million that 300, the last R-rated graphic-novel movie from director Zack Snyder, earned on its opening weekend two years ago.\n\nAnd aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, \"Watchmen's\" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie).\n\nI'd argue, in fact, that this opening is a bit soft, considering the great expectations that came with Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book -- not to mention \"Watchmen's\" hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on Friday and throughout its first day. After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday.\n\nThese are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come.\n\nElsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what \"Watchmen\" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs.\n\nTyler Perry's \"Madea Goes to Jail\" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date.\n\n\"Taken\" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million.\n\nBest Picture winner \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'?\n\nMeanwhile, \"Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience\" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million. According to Box Office Mojo, that's the 15th biggest second-weekend decline of all time.\n\nOverall, the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago, when 10,000 B.C. opened big, making this the fifth consecutive \"up\" weekend at the multiplex.

The survey of parents was conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nThe results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents of children ages 3 to 17.iReport.com: How has autism affected your family?\n\n\n\nIn the study, parents were asked whether a health care provider had ever told them their child had an autism spectrum disorder. ASD is a group of brain disorders comprising autism and two less severe disorders: Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.\n\n\n\nChildren with the disorder show impairment in social interaction and in their ability to communicate. They often display repetitive behavior.  Watch families discuss autism \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe investigators also asked a follow-up question: Were the children considered to have ASD now? Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no.\n\n\n\nThat finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed, since the disorders are not considered curable.\n\n\n\nBut Kogan said the two surveys cannot be compared because the earlier investigators did not ask the follow-up question about whether the children were still considered to have the disorder.\n\n\n\nStill, based on the findings, lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among U.S. children ages 3 to 17 at 110 per 10,000 -- slightly more than 1 percent.\n\n\n\nBoys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD, and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children.\n\n\n\nHe estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States.\n\n\n\nMonday's findings of nearly 1 in 100 appear to indicate an increase from the average of 1 in 150 that was reported in 2003, the researchers said.\n\n\n\nThe researchers urged caution in interpreting the change, noting that an increase in diagnoses does not necessarily mean that more children have the disorder. It could simply reflect a heightened awareness of the disorder.\n\n\n\n\"We don't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition, in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently,\" Arias said.\n\n\n\nShe said that preliminary results from a separate, CDC-funded study she is working on also indicate that about 1 percent of children in the United States are affected by ASD. That study is to be published later this year, she said.\n\n\n\n\"This is a behavioral diagnosis, and it's difficult to make, and it's difficult to make at young ages,\" said Dr. Peter van Dyck, HRSA's associate administrator for maternal and child health.\n\n\n\nHalf of the cases were considered mild by their parents, the study reported.\n\n\n\nThe results underscore the importance of creating policies that will result in early identification and intervention, the officials said.\n\n\n\nThe reports raise \"a lot of questions about how we are preparing in terms of housing,

It's 10 feet wide, it's over 200 miles long, and all of this is open to the public.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEdwards also showed us one of his favorite trail features: a beautiful giant bur oak tree simply referred to by Missouri natives as \"the big bur oak.\" Edwards says it's one of the oldest in the state and thinks that it is one of the coolest spots along the trail.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll that exercise and fresh air can certainly rev up an appetite, and Edwards has two favorite places to cure that. For what he calls the best burger in the world, he heads to Booches Billiard Hall, one of his high school hangouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We used to come here in high school when we probably should have been in school. We'd shoot pool, eat booch burgers and just have a good time,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were greeted by one of the owners, Charlie Kurry, who poked a little fun at Edwards' trademark backflip celebration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only thing flipping in here is the burgers,\" Kurry said.

Among them: There may be very few African-Americans in Silicon Valley, but despite this Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, and one becomes successful because he or she has a \"big brain.\" Vivek disagreed. As an Indian-American entrepreneur, he said he sees significant bias in Silicon Valley, and even recounted a specific instance where he was told, \"You people don't make good CEOs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let me say, I think Arrington truly believes everything he has said about the tech world being a meritocracy. Lots of people believe it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not me. I would more properly say that tech markets are a meritocracy. There are very few businesses where an individual in his or her bedroom can create a piece of software that can potentially touch millions of people, and do this without seeking any additional capital. No matter how talented you are, if you want to open a hot new restaurant or a shoe factory, you need lots of money before you start. Not necessarily so with software.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers and businesses, for the most part, don't care about the ethnicity of their software or Internet service vendor. Users want solutions. So if an entrepreneur can get a great product completed cheaply, he or she can often compete on a totally even footing with anyone else. Even if the entrepreneur ultimately needs capital, explosive initial success knocks down all known barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the market makers operate in a world that is not particularly evenhanded. The market makers are the folks who help new young companies and entrepreneurs by providing insight, mentoring, capital and relationships. This part of the tech world is driven by all the same biases that exist in the nontech world. And it is much harder for even the most talented African-Americans in the tech world to gain access to influential, insightful, connected mentors, let alone investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this? For the most part, people want to work with people who are \"like them\" or who fit a pattern that appeals to them. There is an actual term for this among tech investors called \"pattern matching.\" It's the idea that, without objective facts, one can decide whether someone is likely to be successful based on indirect criteria. In other words, when they see a particular pattern of \"personhood,\" they are excited.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch trailer for CNN documentary \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese patterns are discussed openly in the tech industry around issues like age. Since it is only moderately politically incorrect to suggest that younger entrepreneurs are \"better,\" it is done all the time. The best example of this might be Mike Moritz from Sequoia Capital, perhaps the most influential of all venture funds, admitting in a Building 43 interview that they have a strong bias toward very young entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you believe that age is the only criteria that venture capitalists use for pattern matching, I wanna smoke some of what you've got.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, I am not saying any venture capitalist says at a partner meeting, \"You know I really like this company's product, but did you notice he's a Negro?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNever happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I firmly believe, based on my 25 years in this industry, that market makers, both investors and the people who help you get ready to approach them, seek out entrepreneurs who appeal to them on some less than objective, visceral level, who feel \"comfortable\" to them. They don't need to actively filter out undesirable profiles. They just focus on what does appeal to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoledad O'Brien: Michael Arrington is right (about one thing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey focus on the \"patterns\" they find appealing -- age is arguably a part of ", "qas": [{"question": "What did the Tech crunch founder call silicone valley?", "id": "f28b7801ac5e4385a6e8999492e8974f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 481, "text": "a pure meritocracy,"}]}, {"question": "What Hank Williams said about founder of TechCrunch?", "id": "cc82210865b84c0fba91c2ec5b5f534d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 787, "text": "I think Arrington truly believes everything he has"}]}, {"question": "Who has been involved in a Twitter spat?", "id": "6f86cbec527c4c75862e16b938872404", "answers": [{"answer_start": 76, "text": "Michael Arrington,"}]}, {"question": "Who called Silicon Valley a meritorcracy?", "id": "2c9ff035684f49099a2147c4f17a2992", "answers": [{"answer_start": 76, "text": "Michael Arrington,"}]}, {"question": "Who said it was not so?", "id": "349744fdc69c490ba50ba01f9d31f9a3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 140, "text": "Vivek Wadhwa,"}]}]}]}, {"title": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sailors aboard a U.S. ocean su", "paragraphs": [{"context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sailors aboard a U.S. ocean surveillance ship reacted with a mix of bemusement and profanity to what they said was harassment by Chinese ships earlier this month, according to video released Friday by the Pentagon.\n\n\n\nThe Navy says this shows a trawler crew member using a hook to try to snag the Impeccable's towed acoustic array.\n\n\n\n\"Chinese aggression, from aboard the USNS Impeccable,\" one member of the American ship's crew is heard narrating. \"Details at 11.\"\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon has raised concerns about a March 8 incident in which \"increasingly aggressive\" Chinese ships harassed the Impeccable, an unarmed survey ship with a mostly civilian crew.\n\n\n\nChina's government accused the ship of violating Chinese and international laws during its patrols, which took place more than 100 miles off the Chinese coast.\n\n\n\n\"The U.S. claims are gravely in contravention of the facts and confuse black and white and they are totally unacceptable to China,\" Ma Zhaoxu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said after news of the incident emerged.\n\n\n\nFive Chinese vessels shadowed the Impeccable, with two of them closing to within 25 feet while their crews waved Chinese flags and stripped down to their underwear in a sign of disrespect.

By the time she was 12, Arthur was nearly 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and self-conscious about her height.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting. Along the way, she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about, but she kept the last name -- Arthur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway. Critics delighted in her haughty, serpent-tongued deliveries.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called \"Once Upon a Tune,\" but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on \"Studio One,\" \"Kraft Television Theatre\" and \"The Sid Caesar Show.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur drew attention in \"Threepenny Opera\" on Broadway with Lotte Lenya, but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in \"Fiddler on the Roof.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1966, Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play \"Mame,\" playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role. Eight years later, she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball, but by then she was already well-established as Maude.\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur left \"Maude\" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward. She starred in a short-lived series, \"Amanda's,\" in 1983 and then joined the cast of \"The Golden Girls\" in 1985 with Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida.

White, McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show, renamed \"The Golden Palace,\" but the show lasted only one season without Arthur.\n\n\n\n\n\nArthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992, returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts.

But what happened just goes to show how the unlikeliest events can affect you at the unlikeliest times.\n\n\n\n\n\nI flew from covering the historic visit of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in North Korea to Dharamsala, India. This is the home-in-exile of the Dalai Lama and his government, as well as thousands of Tibetan monks and supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur visit coincided with the events that commemorate each March 10, the date the Dalai Lama fled Tibet on horseback in 1959. He managed to evade the Chinese Communist forces, disguised as a soldier and escaping at night. The somber remembrance is a little like what the Palestinians do every year. They call it al-Nakba, or \"catastrophe,\" which marks 1948 when they lost much of their land as the state of Israel was founded.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, however, the March 10 anniversary took on a more ominous tone. It was the first time the growing split among Tibetan exiles burst into the open. Some of the younger generation of exiles are losing faith in the Dalai Lama's abandonment of the dream of Tibetan independence. Some want action, even if it might mean abandoning their peaceful Buddhist way.\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to ask the Dalai Lama about this and where he thought it would lead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day we visited, we attended a \"Long Life Ceremony\" in which thousands of Tibetans come from all over India and across the Himalayas from Tibet to catch a glimpse of their spiritual leader, to pray for his continued health and long life and to bestow their most precious gifts upon him, including cubes of dried cheese wrapped in muslin, textiles and tapestries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt went on for more than two hours. I never thought I would sit through the whole thing, but something about the chanting, the incense and the vital connection between the Dalai Lama and his adoring flock was mesmerizing.  Watch: Amanpour investigates new breed of Buddhists \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a journalist and an observer, I was transfixed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the Dalai Lama has spent nearly 60 years in exile, people are still so faithful to him, so respectful, weeping, bowing low as they pass him sitting high above on his throne-like dais. He towers over them, and yet there is nothing removed or dictatorial about him.  See behind-the-scenes photos from Buddha's Warriors \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards we prepared for our interview. He gives many, and I wondered what we could elicit from him that would be new or noteworthy. As our cameramen were setting up, I hung around outside to quietly watch as he received the first of many visitors that day: dignitaries, ordinary tourists, prayer groups and school groups.  I've found you can tell almost everything about a person by observing the way they deal with others. He was kind, witty, warm, laugh-out-loud funny and deeply moved by some of the personal tales he heard from those visitors seeking his advice and blessing. I thought about how he must do this so many hundreds of thousands of times and yet he had time for everyone, treating each one like a VIP.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we sat down, I was immediately slightly thrown off by his style. He told us very clearly that what the Chinese are doing in Tibet amounts to \"cultural genocide.\" And then he burst into his trademark giggles.

Many house tiny hotels, like the secluded Dorint S\u00f6l'ring Hof (1 Am Sandwall, Rantum; 49-4651/836-200; doubles from $550), a 15-room inn tucked into the dunes on the southern coast with its own hidden stretch of sugary sand.\n\n\n\nFor those who want to be closer to the action, there's the Hotel Stadt Hamburg (2 Strandstrasse; 49-4651/8580; doubles from $253), in the charming village of Westerland. You'll have to walk five minutes to the beach, but this tidy hotel, built in 1869, is an ideal base for exploration.\n\n\n\nWhere to eat\n\n\n\nThe island's dining scene attracts a number of German celebrities (Claudia Schiffer, Boris Becker), and many frequent the stylish Sansibar (80 H\u00f6rnumer Str., Rantum; 49-4651/964-656; dinner for two $130). The restaurant's North Sea-meets-Asian dishes, like fresh mussels in a sweet curry sauce, are a potent draw.\n\n\n\nIn Kampen, you'll find Greta's Rauchfang (5 Str\u00f6nwai; 49-4651/ 42672; dinner for two $92) next to Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s. Here, socialites enjoy bottles of Kristall (opened dramatically with sabers), along with small plates of the sweet local shrimp.\n\n\n\nTo get away from the fabulous set, head to Alter Gasthof (5 Alte Dorfstrasse, List; 49-4651/877-244; dinner for two $65) on the isle's northern tip. This 200-year-old inn dishes out classic regional food, including stellar house-smoked salmon and eel.\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\nSylt is known for its nude beaches. The most famous is Buhne 16 (133A Listlandstrasse, Kampen), where Germans of every stripe let it all hang out as they lounge in wicker basket chairs. For those who like things a bit more covered up, try Am Roten Kliff, just north of Kampen, which is also (no surprise) less crowded.\n\n\n\nAn ideal way to see the island -- especially in late summer when the heather is in full bloom -- is by bike. Fahrrad am Bahnhof (49-4651/5803), in Westerland's main train station, has a terrific rental selection, and the staff will happily suggest a route along Sylt's 136 miles of well-laid-out paths.\n\n\n\nGetting there\n\n\n\nSylt is reached by train from Berlin (5 hours) or Hamburg (3 1/2 hours). By car, take the autobahn to Nieb\u00fcll from Berlin (290 miles) or Hamburg (120 miles). There is no road connecting Sylt to the mainland; vehicles board a train for the 30-minute trip to the island. For more, see bahn.de.\n\n\n\nPlanning a beach getaway?

This action is taking place on an Indian reservation.\n\n\n\nRichard Bowers Jr. says the Native American Group is intended to help tribes with basic needs.\n\n\n\nBusiness at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, is booming and contributing to the Seminole Indian Tribe's great wealth.\n\n\n\nNow the Seminoles are taking that wealth -- and the power that comes with it -- and using it to do something that has not been done before: organizing Native American tribes with the intent of spreading economic opportunities across Indian Country.\n\n\n\n\"Some of these reservations I have been to -- it's like the Third World right here in the United States,\" says Richard Bowers Jr. As president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida Inc., Bowers has oversight over all the Hard Rock caf\u00e9s, hotels and casinos in the world except the caf\u00e9 in London and the casino in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nThe Seminole Tribe purchased the Hard Rock properties in 2007 for a reported $965 million.\n\n\n\nBowers, a former alligator wrester and cattle rancher, is thankful for his tribe's success and has used his influence to create a consortium of Native American Tribes called the Native American Group. The goal of this group is to bring tribes throughout the United States and Canada together in an effort to promote Native American-owned businesses and services.\n\n\n\nKeeping the dollar within Indian Country, Bowers hopes, will help the less fortunate tribes with basic needs such as housing, food and education.\n\n\n\n\"I view this as historic in nature,\" says Donald Laverdure, the chief legal counsel from Montana's Crow Tribe. \"We haven't had first-nation to first-nation actually occur, and now with the success of the Seminoles and others, they have an opportunity to help tribes such as ourselves.\"\n\n\n\nThe help that the Crow Nation seeks is financial. For the Crow Tribe, gaming is not an option, according to Laverdure.\n\n\n\n\"There's less population, so the success in gaming cannot be paralleled as elsewhere,\" he says. \"So we've always viewed our future in energy.\"\n\n\n\nThat energy would come from coal. The Crow Tribe wants to mine some of the 9 billion tons of coal that it estimates is on its land.\n\n\n\nCrow Nation Chairman Cedric Black Eagle hopes the success of his tribe will lie in turning coal into liquid diesel. \"It will open the door for Indian Country in energy fields and help this country start veering away from its dependence on foreign oil,\" he says.\n\n\n\nAs the group meets to discuss coal, Bowers recalls that it was the need for beef that prompted his idea for the Native American Group.\n\n\n\n\"Here we have all these cafes, casinos -- everybody eats a hamburger,\" says Bowers. \"And than (I) realized that we don't have enough beef to supply our own needs, and that's when I reached out to other Native Americans that did have cattle.\"\n\n\n\nBowers discovered there are more than 2 million heads of cattle on Indian land. If there is not enough cattle on Indian land, then members of the group are encouraged to keep the business in the country and buy American.\n\n\n\nThe Native American Group has come a long way since Bowers was looking for cattle. The group now has more than 100 tribal members and more than 100 Native-owned businesses.\n\n\n\nOne successful business that joined the group is the largest Native American-owned contractor, Flintco. Robin Flint Ballenger, who is Cherokee, is its chairman of the board.\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't a far stretch for me at all to take a risk on this new organization because we are successful, we're doing very well,\" says Ballenger, who adds that a third of the company's work is done for Native America.\n\n\n\nOne of the projects Flintco is working on is a casino being built on Choctaw tribal land in Durant", "qas": [{"question": "What will help less fortunate tribes?", "id": "58487a8f39d745abb6c2823ba3bcd2ab", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1554, "text": "Keeping the dollar within Indian Country, Bowers hopes,"}]}, {"question": "Which tribe owns the property?", "id": "1cf7fd231c584939838ed6ec3f192f26", "answers": [{"answer_start": 384, "text": "Seminole"}]}, {"question": "How many Native-owned businesses are a part of The Native American Group?", "id": "36243b6f2e134d4f94c63ff7f739150e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3401, "text": "more than 100"}]}, {"question": "How many businesses are owned by the Native American Group?", "id": "cacc201f681d4e33ac294b7210b3f030", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3401, "text": "more than 100"}]}, {"question": "Who owns Hard Rock properties?", "id": "894e88efeef14e0e87486904b79bc5aa", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1094, "text": "The Seminole Tribe"}]}, {"question": "What Native American tribe owns Hard Rock properties?", "id": "cab4cf53e8694388b5596d14d729756a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 478, "text": "Seminole Indian"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(MentalFloss.com) -- 1.

Earlier this year, Brooklyn-based designer Andrew Schneider invented the first solar powered bikini -- the \"iKini\" -- which produces enough electricity to power an iPod during a sunny day at the beach. Just remember to unplug it, the inventor says, before taking a dip.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The famous white belted bikini worn by Ursula Andress in the 1962 James Bond hit \"Dr. No\" sold for $61,500 at Christie's in London in 2001. Halle Barry modeled a redux of a similar suit in the 2002 Bond flick, \"Die Another Day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n4. French designer Jacques Heim's first itsy-bitsy bathing suit hit the fashion scene in 1946. Tapping into the worldwide obsession with nuclear physics, he named his tiny invention the \"atom.\" A few months later, another French designer, Louis Reard, one-upped Heim, revealing an even tinier suit, which he dubbed the \"bikini\" after Bikini Atoll, the island in the Pacific where the U.S. had tested the atom bomb. The new swimsuit, it was said, was as small as an atom and just as powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.

In 2009, Americans spent $4.3 billion -- roughly $400 million more than the GDP of Barbados -- on swimwear alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. The 19th-century version of a bikini was made out of either heavy flannel or wool -- fabrics that would not be transparent when wet -- and covered the entire body from neck to toe. The suits were so heavy that women had to hold onto ropes strung from the beach to offshore buoys to keep from sinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. The bikini rocketed to fame in 1960 with Brian Hyland's hit single, \"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.\" The famous 30 inches of fabric didn't debut on the cover of Sports Illustrated until 1964.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: 25 brand names mistakenly used as generic terms\n\n\n\n\n\n9. At the 1964 International Beauty Pageant in Long Beach, California, Miss Austria stormed out of a photoshoot after being told she could not wear her homemade bikini. \"Americans are rude,\" she said. \"I'm tanned all over, so I wanted the suntan to show.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n10. In 2009, a group of vegetarian ladies campaigned in international cities wearing bikinis made only of lettuce leaves. The \"Lettuce Ladies\" as they were called, were sponsored by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and hoped to convince people to adopt a meatless diet.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Floss: When did women start shaving their armpits?\n\n\n\n\n\n11. In 1993, the Olympic Committee decreed the bikini the official uniform for women's beach volleyball, partly because of the functionality of the suit.

His father Surinder and elder brother Boney are film producers, his daughter Sonam, sister-in-law Sridevi and his younger brother Sanjay are actors, while son-in-law Sandeep Marwah is a movie magnate and Anil's son Harshvardhan is currently learning to direct movies in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nBut things weren't always so glamorous. Anil Kapoor was born on Christmas Eve 1959 and grew up in a tenement in the Mumbai suburb of Chembur, with eight people living together in a single room. His father Surinder had yet to make his name in the film industry, but young Anil clearly had movies in his blood. \"In my childhood I was surrounded by films, actors, film makers, directors and film talk. I would bunk school to watch movies,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHe was cast in his first movie aged just seven. Although the film was never released, the experience was enough to convince Kapoor that his future lay in the movies.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing school he went to St Xavier's College, where he acted in plays and won the Best Actor trophy at an inter-collegiate competition, before being expelled for non-attendance. Kapoor responded by enrolling in acting classes and taking singing and dance lessons.\n\n\n\nHe made his Bollywood debut in 1979's \"Hamare Tumhare,\" before moving on to Telugu-language movie \"Vamsa Vriksham\" in 1980, and landing his first Bollywood starring role in 1983's \"Woh 7 Din.\"\n\n\n\nWatch Anil Kapoor take CNN on a tour of Mumbai. \u00bb\n\n\n\nKapoor first met future wife Sunita Bhambhani in 1979, when she was a successful model and he was still a struggling actor. He decided that he would propose marriage as soon as he got his big break and 1984's \"Mashaal\" was the opportunity he'd been waiting for. Kapoor's performance won him Best Supporting Actor at India's prestigious FilmFare awards and he married Sunita in May of that year.\n\n\n\nKapoor cemented his status a Bollywood idol after starring in the hugely successful \"Mr India,\" which promptly became his nickname among a growing legion of fans. He has gone on to become one of the biggest names in Indian cinema, picking up a total of five FilmFare awards and a National Film Institute Best Actor award for his role in 2000's \"Pukar.\"\n\n\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, Kapoor made his debut as a producer in 2002, with the comedy \"Badhaai Ho Badhaai,\" and he went on to produce \"Gandhi, My Father,\" which portrayed the fractious relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal.\n\n\n\nFor years now, in his home town of Mumbai Kapoor has been mobbed by fans wherever he goes, instantly recognizable by his trademark mustache, which he has proudly sported in all but three of his hundred-plus movies.\n\n\n\nBut like most Bollywood stars, he received little acclaim outside India. That changed abruptly and unexpectedly with the release of low-budget British movie \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" The film has become an international sensation, winning four Golden Globe awards and receiving an astonishing 10 Oscar nominations.\n\n\n\nSee Anil Kapoor's \"Slumdog Millionaire\" success in photos. \u00bb\n\n\n\nKapoor's role as the creepy quiz show host earned him a share in the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Cast.

After training, Patch was recruited to The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry as a Lewis gunner assistant.\n\n\n\nThe unit was rushed to the front line trenches of Ypres, where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousand.\n\n\n\nHe fought in the trenches between June and September of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. In late September he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head, bringing an end to his military service.\n\n\n\nHe received battlefield treatment without anesthetic.\n\n\n\nAfter the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer. He married Ada Billington, a young girl he met while convalescing after the battle. They married in 1919 and had two sons.\n\n\n\nIn World War II, Patch joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy German raids on the English cities of Bath and Bristol.\n\n\n\nAt one point, he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil, where he became friendly with some of the men. Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted, with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten, on the morning that the soldiers had gone off to France, the Ministry of Defence said.\n\n\n\nHis wife, Ada, died in 1976, and their two sons also later died.

Even the setting, though new, will be familiar to most readers: Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nThis time, Langdon is lured to the Capitol to save his mentor, Peter Solomon, a prominent member of the Freemasons who's been kidnapped by a cryptic, heavily tattooed, Homer-reading psycho calling himself Mal'akh -- a vicious fellow even less plausible than the albino monk in \"The Da Vinci Code.\"\n\n\n\nOur hero is also in possession of an ancient Masonic artifact whose clues lead him on a treasure hunt to various D.C. tourist spots as he searches for a secret long hidden by the brotherhood.  Watch the frenzy surrounding \"The Lost Symbol\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nThat secret, of course, is one giant MacGuffin -- though Brown is the rare thriller writer who seems to lavish as much attention on the object that sets his plot in motion as he does on the action itself.\n\n\n\nBut for thriller fans, it's the chase that really matters. Especially since the secrets of Freemasonry just aren't as compelling as, say, a controversial theory about Mary Magdalene and Jesus.\n\n\n\nLuckily, Langdon remains a terrific hero, a bookish intellectual who's cool in a crisis and quick on his feet, like Ken Jennings with a shot of adrenaline. The codes are intriguing, the settings present often-seen locales in a fresh light, and Brown mostly manages to keep the pages turning -- except when one of his know-it-all characters decides to brake the action for another superfluous, if occasionally interesting, historical digression. (Did you know there's a carving of Darth Vader on the National Cathedral?)\n\n\n\nEven after the book's climactic showdown, you must slog through another 50-plus pages of exposition that Brown couldn't cram into the main narrative. Sometimes it seems that authors, like their villains, don't know when to leave well enough alone.\n\n\n\nEW Grade: C+\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly", "qas": [{"question": "what is borwns new novel", "id": "928063d9906145b6b83392f5068efb4f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 137, "text": "\"The Lost Symbol,\""}]}, {"question": "who wrote novel da vinci code", "id": "0ad40f362389498382471e1f6171f996", "answers": [{"answer_start": 26, "text": "Dan Brown's"}]}, {"question": "According to EW it doesn't equal his previous novel entitled what?", "id": "57c251b6218b4c1094f9dfb9f53f2a21", "answers": [{"answer_start": 251, "text": "\"The Da Vinci Code\""}]}, {"question": "Dan Brown's new novel is called what?", "id": "b322fdc7819546138582ebc07e8aa7a8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 137, "text": "\"The Lost Symbol,\""}]}, {"question": "who is dan brown", "id": "aa4169b3de364c318562b0b09308caa0", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1285, "text": "rare thriller writer"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(EW.com) -- There's no denying the power of the ro", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(EW.com) -- There's no denying the power of the romantic comedy, even if \"Valentine's Day,\" the movie, is as manufactured as the holiday itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe all-star film grossed an estimated $52.4 million over three days and is likely to top $60 million by the time the Presidents Day holiday weekend is over.

In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- and went on a 100-day killing rampage.\n\n\n\nIn June of 1994, Rwanda was still in the grip of a 100-day killing rampage.\n\n\n\nCivilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million, 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents.\n\n\n\nWhat started the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry\n\n\n\nThe Tutsi ethnic minority and the Hutu majority had been at odds even before 1994. The rivalry started during colonial times, when the Belgians considered Tutsis the privileged ethnicity, thus giving them better opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe Hutus were considered inferior, prompting resentment that was passed on through the generations. The first major assault on Tutsis occurred in 1959, killing thousands and prompting more attacks over the years.\n\n\n\nThe animosity caused the Tutsis to flee to neighboring countries, including Burundi and Uganda. The Hutus took over the government when Rwanda gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, but the resentment remained.\n\n\n\nHours before the genocide\n\n\n\nIn early April, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The president, his Burundian counterpart and their aides were killed. A few hours later, Rwanda erupted into chaos.\n\n\n\nSome have accused current President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi, of masterminding the killing. Kagame, who led a Tutsi militia group at the time, has denied any ties. He has accused Hutu rebels of instigating the assassinations to incite fury and attacks on Tutsis.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Hutus and Tutsis\n\n\n\nThey speak the same language and practice the same customs. However, most Tutsis are considered tall and lanky, which has led to speculation that they have Ethiopian heritage. During the genocide, the bodies of Tutsis were thrown into rivers by the Hutus, who said they were sending them back to Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nThe aftermath of the genocide\n\n\n\nAfter 100 days of death and destruction, the Tutsi militia led by Kagame defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the government. Scores of Hutus fled to neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where they have been accused of inciting more violence. Rwanda has invaded Congo various times to launch an offensive against Hutus allegedly linked to the genocide.\n\n\n\nAfter the cease-fire, a multiethnic government made up of Hutu President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Kagame came into power. Bizimungu was later accused of ethnic discord and jailed. Kagame became president in 2000.\n\n\n\nTrials for genocide suspects\n\n\n\nTop officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide are tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried in gacaca courts.\n\n\n\nThe latter are community courts conducted by a panel of nine civilians in an open field.\n\n\n\nThe courts allow survivors to point out and confront their attackers. Gacaca means \"open grass\" in the local language. Human rights organizations say the gacacas fall short on delivering justice.\n\n\n\nState of the nation 15 years later\n\n\n\nRwanda is now considered one of Africa's most stable nations. Education, health care, tourism and trade -- which were destroyed in the genocide -- have improved dramatically. Kagame has made big strides against corruption, a major problem in Africa.\n\n\n\nHowever, critics have accused him of being an autocratic leader who has stifled the country's media. Others have said the growth in economy is limited to urban areas and has not trickled into rural areas.", "qas": [{"question": "How many died during the killing?", "id": "c524775cfdfd474691b06c6c05dc4cd2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 102, "text": "800,000 dead."}]}, {"question": "Which is the most stable nation in Africa?", "id": "6143a2a8fba6403bac9b1a61c403d540", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3648, "text": "Rwanda"}]}, {"question": "What is the hatred between?", "id": "9b6459e60add477cb7b5c6df85dcc727", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2030, "text": "Hutus and Tutsis"}]}, {"question": "What lasted 100 days?", "id": "8e55899b8be04ddc97c6cae4f4d01699", "answers": [{"answer_start": 273, "text": "killing rampage."}]}, {"question": "What is Rwanda considered?", "id": "97b0da00c8d64c7e9cf9ca56599a06e8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3673, "text": "one of Africa's most stable nations."}]}, {"question": "What caused genocide between Tutsi and Hutu in 1994?", "id": "2546878366e744218972a0eb6c7c650b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 977, "text": "the privileged ethnicity,"}]}, {"question": "How long was the rampage?", "id": "f40c50b5bb8e4c7b9eb852a860a71d2f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 265, "text": "100-day"}]}, {"question": "For how long killing were between Tutsi and Hutu?", "id": "e957032916604030a309b46e81fd7382", "answers": [{"answer_start": 265, "text": "100-day"}]}]}]}, {"title": "Washington (CNN) -- As the United States completes", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Washington (CNN) -- As the United States completes its withdrawal of all military forces from Iraq by the end of the month, Iraq's prime minister made a pitch to leaders of American commerce and industry Tuesday: Iraq is open for business.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an address to American executives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said his country offers \"limitless\" opportunities for American companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Maliki said his country is trying to diversify from an energy-dominated economy, to one that focuses on financial, medical, agricultural, educational and infrastructure services as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end of U.S. military operations in Iraq heralds the beginning of a \"wider relationship\" between the two countries where \"not generals but businessmen\" will focus on economic and political engagement between the two countries, al-Maliki told the audience. He spoke to more than 400 executives representing a wide range of industries including petroleum, engineering and construction, commercial aviation, architecture, maritime cargo and financial services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs U.S. investment in Iraq has increased since 2008, al-Maliki said Iraq wants to see a much greater presence of U.S. companies in his country to help spur greater spending and investment on the country's infrastructure as a way to better the lives of Iraqis and create more U.S. jobs in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal foreign direct investment in Iraq hit $70 billion for the first months of 2011, according to the chamber. The United States has increased its investment from nearly nearly $2 billion in 2010 to more than $8 billion this year, the organization said. That figure represents 11.6% of all investment entering Iraq, the chamber said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has projected the Iraqi economy to grow at a faster pace than China or India over the next two to three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite growing U.S. investment in Iraq, the chamber continued its own pitch to U.S. businesses of the potential Iraq represents for them, and American workers, before al-Maliki spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We continue to trail our trading partners with respect to investment and economic engagement in Iraq,\" said Lionel Johnson, vice president for Middle East and North African Affairs at the chamber. The private sector stands to play a crucial role in filling the capacity void left in many sectors of the Iraqi economy following the U.S. military departure, Johnson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWinning business for American firms in Iraq has not been an easy prospect in the past. Not a single U.S. energy firm secured a deal for oil production at an auction of contracts by the Iraqi government two years ago. Many members of Congress were outraged, and questioned the U.S. investment in Iraq to that point after lucrative multi-billion-dollar contracts went to Russian and Chinese firms instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past year, the United States Business Council in Iraq was established to advance commercial interests for American firms operating in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity aside, al-Maliki acknowledged the difficulty of moving his country from the planned economy of the Saddam Hussein era to a market-based system governed by transparency laws and international regulations, not to mention convincing American businesses to invest in a country that still experiences a high volume of violence. He assured his audience that his government was doing all it could to root out corruption and make the country safe for businesses to operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Make no mistake, this is a country that's developing, its commerce is developing, it's going to take time, it's going to take energy,\" Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides told CNN after al-Maliki spoke. \"U.S. companies are going there because they believe they can make money and at the end of the day that's what it is about, and most of these companies have dealt with complicated environments. Iraq is no different, but we have seen huge progress.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNides said the \"robust diplomatic staff\" still based in Iraq after the military withdrawal will include large economic and legal teams to work with U.S. companies operating in Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 40 leaders from the Iraqi private sector made the trip to Washington with al-Maliki to meet with their American counterparts.", "qas": [{"question": "With what organization Al-Maliki has business talks?", "id": "88289b7898cf44bdb3bd88d62391a03b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 289, "text": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce"}]}, {"question": "What will build the U.S.-Iraq relationship?", "id": "70903ce347bf4339a8eb3f17576ddf6f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 644, "text": "end of U.S. military operations"}]}, {"question": "What does Al-Maliki say Iraq wants to see?", "id": "59d1e4a40a3f4aad9a0e5ae95b711322", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1192, "text": "a much greater presence of U.S. companies in his country to help spur greater spending and investment on the country's infrastructure"}]}, {"question": "When were Iraqi contracts auctioned?", "id": "1ffcd2e9e37749d7ac35f3229327a97e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2668, "text": "two years ago."}]}, {"question": "Who talked business?", "id": "936773dbfb6c42989c8090f992429d0d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 329, "text": "Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki"}]}, {"question": "Who talked business with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce?", "id": "a06f4131fee84de1b4b796edbfc4dbfa", "answers": [{"answer_start": 329, "text": "Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki"}]}, {"question": "Who said he wants to see more us companies in his country?", "id": "3a15cda812324bc0adabb898c0f18a04", "answers": [{"answer_start": 329, "text": "Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki"}]}]}]}, {"title": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- The theater was packed ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- The theater was packed as Garth Brooks shared stories about why he decided to officially step out of retirement after nine years.\n\n\n\nGarth Brooks played two secret concerts in Vegas earlier this summer. Now he's signed on for an engagement.\n\n\n\nCamera crews and journalists filled the front section. Executives flanked the sides. And then smack dab in the middle of the audience was a row of chefs, enthusiastically applauding in their toques and kitchen whites.\n\n\n\nYes, the media was buzzing about the much-anticipated announcement, but hotel employees at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas were equally excited -- maybe even more so, because of the part they played in persuading the country music superstar to enter into a five-year weekend residency at the establishment beginning December 11.\n\n\n\nThis summer, as the media threw itself head-first into the death of Michael Jackson, the Oklahoma native quietly took the stage at the 1,500-seat Encore Theater in two hush-hush shows attended by hotel workers. One was an intimate acoustic performance; the other a concert with his full band.\n\n\n\nHe sang. He charmed. He won over staffers who never thought they'd be caught dead tapping their toes to country music. And that, ladies and gentleman, exemplifies the uncanny ability of Garth Brooks to connect with human beings, and explains why he -- not Michael Jackson -- is the best-selling solo artist of all time in any genre. (You can look it up.)\n\n\n\n\"I think my gift truly is I'm an average guy. What I like, an average guy likes. It's that simple.

Even though he's pushed boundaries and rewritten rules in the music industry, he's still an old-fashioned guy with old-fashioned values -- work hard, stay humble and family first. It's the latter that led to his decision to hang up his mic and his Stetson in 2000.\n\n\n\n\"We were retiring because I gotta get back to Oklahoma and raise my girls. Sandy and I were getting a divorce at the time, so I couldn't expect her to do my job for me any longer,\" he said. \"We told the people that's what I'm going to do, and the people -- 99 percent of them -- said, 'Go.

His new Friday-through-Sunday gig will allow him to keep his pledge of seeing them off to class until they head to college.\n\n\n\nOf course, the commute from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to Vegas will be made a little faster with his new private jet -- an 11-seat Challenger, courtesy of Steve Wynn, the billionaire CEO of Wynn Hotels.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know anything about jets,\" Brooks downplayed with a shrug. \"It's got a cool interior, cool paint job, I don't know.

His wife and kids, the housebroken dog, the vacation home on Cape Cod all vanished when he was sent to prison for an arson in 1996.\n\n\n\nKenneth Brown, a former inmate, learned to meditate during his nine years in prison.\n\n\n\nTrapped in his gloomy cell and serving a 20-year sentence that felt like an eternity, Brown, then 49, found himself stretched out on the floor. He was silent. His eyes were shut. His body did not move.\n\n\n\nBrown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating.\n\n\n\n\"I try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me from getting lost,\" said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence.\n\n\n\n\"This helped me stay on track and get me through prison,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEastern religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies, 20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the 1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of unlikely followers behind prison bars.\n\n\n\nThe inmates say meditation -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison.\n\n\n\n\"Mostly, the people in Buddhist community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of mouth gets from one inmate to another,\" explained Gary Friedman, communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. \"It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison environment.\"\n\n\n\nThere is no group tracking the number of inmates converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are sprouting up across the country.\n\n\n\nMeditation can help the convicts find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The practice provides them a chance to reflect on their crimes, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, books like the \"Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism\" and \"Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison\" have emerged.\n\n\n\n\"This is transformative justice, as opposed to punitive,\" said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and Buddhist teachings.\n\n\n\nSince its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with 2,500 individuals, many of them inmates.\n\n\n\nFor the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado.\n\n\n\nSome inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of hours of meditation in a short period of time.\n\n\n\nBuddhism has gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2 million self-identified Buddhists.\n\n\n\nSome inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and follow Buddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering.\n\n\n\nThe practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002. The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Alabama, was notorious for violence. But a group of male inmates, including several murderers, completed a Vipassana meditation retreat that required more than 100 hours of meditation in 10 days.\n\n\n\nOne inmate, who was featured in the 2007 documentary \"The Dhamma Brothers,\" said Vipassana was harder than the 8\u00bd years he had spent on death row.

As many as 5 percent of Americans are at risk for a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction from insect stings, according to the organization.\n\n\n\nIn a typical week in the emergency room, doctors at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, see about six or fewer cases of people with allergic reactions to insects, said Dr. James P. Capes, director of the emergency department.\n\n\n\n\"It's common, but not incredibly common,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTypically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories\n\n\n\nIn the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.\n\n\n\nCapes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.\n\n\n\nEven if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.\n\n\n\nThose who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.\n\n\n\nInsect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.\n\n\n\nSevere reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.\n\n\n\n\"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.\n\n\n\nFor those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said.

She said she does not expect enough additional evidence to surface for that finding to be revised.\n\n\n\nThe remains were identified through DNA testing, comparing a sample from the remains to a sample known to be from Caylee. Some of the remains had been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for testing.\n\n\n\nThe skull was found December 11 a half-mile from the home of Caylee's grandparents, where the girl and her mother, Casey Anthony, 22, lived before the girl disappeared.

But when the family went to Blue Smoke restaurant Sunday afternoon in New York, someone had already asked to hold the peanuts.\n\n\n\nAva Zinna ate an allergen-free meal at the Worry Free Dinners event on Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe Zinnas took part in Worry Free Dinners, a series of monthly meals for people with food allergies. Sunday's 16-person barbecue -- complete with ribs, chicken, burgers and brownies -- was the first event aimed directly at parents and children affected by food allergies.\n\n\n\n\"When you're going into a restaurant environment, you're putting your child's safety and livelihood into other hands,\" Tara Zinna said. At the Worry Free Dinners event, \"not only was the food phenomenal, but it's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues.\"\n\n\n\nThe recent \"worry free\" meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels. Since 2006, food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit.\n\n\n\nRestaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies. When the meal arrives, there's often no way of knowing every single ingredient that went into it, or what else touched the plate and utensils used to serve it. You also have to pester the restaurant staff with special requests.\n\n\n\nBut with Worry Free Dinners, everyone has some kind of experience with all of that, which helps build camaraderie, said Sloane Miller, who started organizing the events in April.  Read more tips on how to manage food allergies \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"People sit down and start chatting immediately like they're old friends,\" said Miller, known in the blogosphere as \"Allergic Girl.\" \"It's so nice to be with people that you don't have to explain [to] why you want something on the side.\"\n\n\n\nSo far, Worry Free Dinners has catered to food allergy sufferers in New York -- there are about 12 million in America, according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) -- but Miller is looking to take the concept to other cities.\n\n\n\nA common but mysterious condition\n\n\n\nOne out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy, and some will outgrow their sensitivities, said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of FAAN. But allergies to peanuts, nuts, shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong, she said. As far as she knows, Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind.\n\n\n\nExperts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise, but no one is sure why. Research on food allergies has been slow because \"for a long time, people thought this was a small problem,\" Munoz-Furlong said. The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress, including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies, she said.\n\n\n\nThe majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"cyclic,\" with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies: sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, said Dr. Alpen Patel, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University. Other people experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods.\n\n\n\nBut for some people, ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis, a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways, cardiovascular collapse, and even death. This is called a \"fixed food allergy,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAfter one severe reaction, he said, most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack.

faith.\n\n\n\nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government has been accused of trying to eliminate the Baha'i community.\n\n\n\nBani Dugal, the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations, called Iran's assertion \"utterly baseless.\"\n\n\n\n\"The allegations are not new, and the Iranian government knows well that they are untrue,\" Dugal said on Wednesday, quoted in a news release issued by the Baha'i movement.\n\n\n\n\"The documented plan of the Iranian government has always been to destroy the Baha'i community, and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan.\"\n\n\n\nIranian government spokesman Gholam-Hossein Elham said the people were detained for \"security issues\" and not their faith, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said.\n\n\n\nElham said on Tuesday that the Baha'is were members of a group working together \"against national interest.\"\n\n\n\n\"The group is an organized establishment linked to foreigners, the Zionists in particular,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe arrests of the six last week and another Baha'i leader in March sparked sharp condemnation by the Baha'is, the United States, Canada, the European Union and humanitarian groups.\n\n\n\nThe Baha'is say the latest arrests are part of a pattern of religious persecution since 1979, when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created in the predominantly Shiite nation.\n\n\n\nThe Baha'is say they have been killed, jailed and \"otherwise oppressed\" only because of their religion.\n\n\n\n\"The best proof of this is the fact that, time and again, Baha'is have been offered their freedom if they recant their Baha'i beliefs and convert to Islam, an option few have taken,\" Dugal said.\n\n\n\nDugal said Iran's practice of connecting the group to Zionism, the underlying political philosophy of the Jewish state, was a \"distortion\" and an attempt to \"stir animosity\" among the Iranian public.\n\n\n\nThe Baha'i World Center, which the movement refers to as its \"spiritual and administrative heart,\" is in the Acre/Haifa area in northern Israel -- a location that predates the founding of the state of Israel since it was formed during the Ottoman Empire's rule of Palestine.\n\n\n\nThe Baha'is explain that their founder, Baha'u'llah, \"after a series of successive banishments from his native Persia, was exiled, with members of his family and a small band of his followers, to the Turkish penal colony of Acre in 1868.\"\n\n\n\nDugal said the Iranian actions were the \"most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the Baha'is as agents of foreign powers, whether of Russia, the United Kingdom, or the United States and now Israel all of which are completely baseless.\"\n\n\n\nDugal said the government's philosophies are based largely on the idea that there can be \"no prophet following Mohammed\" and that the faith \"poses a theological challenge to this belief.\"\n\n\n\nThey say Baha'u'llah is regarded by Baha'is as \"the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ and Mohammed.\"\n\n\n\nThe Baha'is-- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- say they have 5 million members

Also, you can go to Emilio Castelar, a street in Polanco full of life and good-looking people.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your favorite neighborhood? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\nColonia Roma is becoming the \"Mexican Soho,\" with lots of galleries, restaurants, bars, boutique hotels, fountains and squares.

If you don't want to step into a museum, go downtown to see El Zocalo (Mexico City's main square) and Templo Mayor, the remains of an ancient Aztec temple.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a \"tourist trap\" that's actually worth seeing?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest tourist trap is Plaza Garibaldi, were the mariachis are awful and you can get mugged. A trap that could be worth seeing is the area called Xochimilco, often called \"Mexican Venice\" because of a series of canals.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere was your most memorable meal? Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town?\n\n\n\n\n\nZinco bar, on Cinco de Mayo Street in downtown, has great jazz music and a very cheerful crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot really.

His nonprofit, Faith*Hope*Love*Charity, has provided food, housing, counseling, employment and medical services to more than 1,100 veterans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was somewhat overwhelmed at the tribute. To be a part of something that you love doing -- to be honored in doing it was, you know, strange,\" recalled Foster, 54. \"But then to be showcased internationally was tremendous. And it's still reaping benefits today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those benefits is Foster's recent opening of the First Stop Resource Center and Housing Program in Palm Beach, Florida. The center and program widen the scope of support services his organization has been offering through its original Stand Down House. They also bring Foster's long-held dream to fruition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Twenty years ago, the dream was to be able to provide assistance and services for homeless veterans and their entire family,\" he said. \"We did come up with Stand Down House 10 years ago, but there was never that support for the family or the female veterans. This year, we've been fortunate enough to complete that vision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe First Stop Resource Center assists veterans and their families through various periods of crises, including homelessness and addiction. Before its addition, Foster and his team had to send veterans in need from one partner aid agency to another over multiple days, in multiple locations -- increasing the risk of losing clients back to the streets.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the new resource center, veterans in need are able to meet with any of First Stop's 15 community aid partners under one roof in a single visit. They can receive assistance with housing, legal, medical care, employment, child care, education, pensions, food stamps and transportation needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were looking to establish a place where we will not lose them in that process of 'hurry up and wait,' \" Foster said. \"We want to centralize it. We want to get their needs addressed and ... get these service members back out into the community. That's what it's about.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Stop's housing program is geared toward female veterans and veterans with children. Set adjacent to the organization's original Stand Down House for male veterans, the two new residence buildings can provide temporary housing for up to eight single female veterans and two small families. It is only the second transitional housing facility in the nation available to veterans with children, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're trying to empower the family structure, because if the family struggles, the soldier struggles. When the soldier struggles, it puts everyone at risk,\" Foster said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbara Williams is First Stop's first female resident. An Operation Desert Storm veteran, Williams fell on hard times after losing her job last year. Now, she and her daughters have a roof over their heads and the hope of better days to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My pride is restored,\" said Williams, 40. \"I'm able to just go off to look for jobs and not worry about where am I going to go when I come home. It's just so much relief.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seed money for the new housing facility arrived shortly after Foster was announced as a Top 10 CNN Hero.

Her faith remains unshaken by the news that South African police have opened a criminal investigation into allegations that a dorm parent mistreated students at the school.\n\n\n\nHine said her children \"have no problems about the school, they are happy about everything.\"\n\n\n\nInvestigators declined to provide details of the alleged abuse, but the academy's CEO, John Samuel, said in a statement issued earlier this month that an internal inquiry was launched based on a claim of misconduct involving a dormitory parent.  Watch why school is being investigated \u00bb\n\n\n\nAccording to an article in The Cape Argus, a Cape Town newspaper, the dorm parent allegedly grabbed a pupil by the throat and threw her against a wall, the girl claimed. Girls at the school also claimed that the matron swore and screamed at the girls and assaulted them, the newspaper reported Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe newspaper said one of the pupils ran away from the school, blaming the alleged abuse.\n\n\n\nWinfrey personally selected the school's students, all of them straight-A students from underprivileged backgrounds. The students get free tuition, free uniforms, free accommodation and free meals at the school in Henley-on-Klip, near Johannesburg.\n\n\n\nIn Hine's case, her children's status as the \"poorest of the poor\" that the school aims to serve was clear-cut: Hine supports the five people who live in her small two-bedroom Soweto home on the $50 a week she makes from a fruit and vegetable stand. Hine also is caring for two other orphans -- a niece and a younger granddaughter -- as well as Palesa and Alebohang, whom Hine took responsibility for when her own mother died of AIDS.\n\n\n\nAlong with the money she scrapes together, the family survives on food baskets they receive once a month from a charity.\n\n\n\nHine attended an emergency meeting with Winfrey when the talk-show host came to the school two weeks ago.\n\n\n\n\"She was emotional, she was crying when she was talking about her daughters. It is not our daughters anymore, it is Oprah's daughters,\" Hine said.\n\n\n\nWinfrey did not give the parents details of the allegations other than to say that the dormitory parent \"didn't treat the girls the way she likes,\" Hine said. She said parents were told at the start of the meeting that Winfrey \"does not want the thing to be in the media. It was a private meeting.\"\n\n\n\nThe controversy that now surrounds the school now offers a sharp contrast to the glitter and air of limitless hope when Winfrey brought a gaggle of Hollywood stars with her to officially open the well-appointed school. The criminal probe was opened after a team of three American experts hired by Winfrey gave police the results of their initial investigation, police said.\n\n\n\n\"We came to the conclusion that there were criminal elements and then we opened the case for investigation,\" said Police Superintendent Lungelo Dlamini.\n\n\n\nDlamini told CNN that the team of U.S. experts hired by Winfrey to conduct the internal investigation included Robert Farley, a retired Cook County, Illinois, detective.

It was grist for a prosecutor's political aspirations, a case that was appealed all the way to the country's highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press.\n\n\n\nAt the center of it all was Leo Frank, a northern Jew who'd moved to Atlanta to supervise the National Pencil Company factory. When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia.\n\n\n\nConsidered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian.\n\n\n\nIn the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs. It has fueled legal discussions, spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums.\n\n\n\nWho murdered Mary Phagan? What forces were behind the lynching of Frank?

Leo Frank,\" will air Monday on PBS. \"The test of us as a society is not necessarily how we treat the best among us but how we treat the most questionable.\"\n\n\n\nMixed in with ongoing analysis of the Phagan-Frank story are the descendants of those involved, people who learned of their connections differently and carry these legacies forward in unique ways.\n\n\n\nThe accused\n\n\n\n\"The story goes that no one in my family talked about it,\" said Cathee Smithline, a 62-year-old great-niece of Frank.\n\n\n\nFrank was the one who handed Mary Phagan her check when she stopped by the factory on April 26, 1913, Confederate Memorial Day. The night watchman, Newt Lee, would find the body and call police early the next day.\n\n\n\nSmithline, of Wyckoff, New Jersey, was 16 when she first heard about the case.

The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground.\n\n\n\nThe GAO report was prepared for the House Education and Labor Committee, which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students.\n\n\n\n\"I think what we're going to hear from the GAO is that very often, special-need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances,\" said Rep. George Miller, D-California, the committee's chairman.\n\n\n\nIn other cases, children as young as 6 have been locked away \"for hours at a time,\" Miller said.\n\n\n\n\"What the GAO is telling us is that that policy is fairly widespread,\" he said. \"The state regulations about how to handle these incidents don't exist in about half the states, and in other states you have kind of a patchwork of regulations.\"\n\n\n\nThe GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that state laws governing the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having \"special needs\" -- conditions including autism and Down syndrome -- are patchy at best. Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs.\n\n\n\nOnly five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school.\n\n\n\nWhen confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution.\n\n\n\nSome of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions.\n\n\n\nState investigators in Utah found a teacher left 7-year-old Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to \"shut up.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the boy was in the cubicle, the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing. His parents, Joshua and Becca Peck, said the child has an attention span of about 10 minutes, and they believe that after the first few minutes, he had no idea why he was in the cubicle.\n\n\n\n\"It was so sad. We felt it was a form of torture for him but he, being autistic, he had no way to express it,\" Joshua Peck said. \"He couldn't tell.\"\n\n\n\nAnd Becca Peck said her son had been left in the cubicle with nothing but a magic marker -- which he used to scrawl all over himself. When she came to school to pick him up, \"He was covered in marker -- on his eyelids, on his hair, face, clothes, arms, eyelids -- everywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\"I started thinking, 'What was he thinking?'

In perhaps his most perfect stunt, the side of a building crashes down on top of him and Keaton is saved only by an open window that fits neatly around him. The window was built to have clearance of two inches around each shoulder and on the top of his head. As Keaton himself said, \"You don't do these things twice.\"\n\n\n\n2. \"Stagecoach\" (John Ford, 1939)   Stunt: High speed stagecoach jump  Stuntman: Yakima Canutt\n\n\n\nEx-rodeo cowboy Yakima Canutt was probably the first celebrity stuntman, best known as a stunt double for John Wayne. In this stunt -- which has since become a Western classic -- he portrays a galloping warrior during an Indian attack on a stagecoach. He jumps from his own horse to the six-horse team pulling the stagecoach, is shot, falls, and is dragged underneath the fast-moving team and stagecoach.\n\n\n\n3. \"Ben Hur\" (William Wyler, 1959)  Stunt: Chariot race Stuntman: Joe Canutt\n\n\n\nCanutt (son of Yakima) doubles for Charlton Heston in the famous chariot race. Half way through, things veer off plan and he is forced down the inside part of the track straight towards a wrecked chariot. When his charito hits, Canutt is flung over the front of the chariot, where he clings before clambering back on. The sequence was completely unplanned but made it into the film because Canutt kept a cool head even though he was injured.\n\n\n\n4. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (Stephen Spielberg, 1981)   Stunt: Truck drag  Stuntman: Terry Leonard\n\n\n\nThis intense stunt sequence was so hazardous to perform that veteran stuntman Terry Leonard only agreed to do it if his friend and fellow stuntman Glenn H. Randall Jr. was driving the truck. A ditch was dug underneath the path of the truck to give Leonard enough room to manoeuver. Harrison Ford, an accomplished stuntman in his own right, performed an earlier portion of the sequence, where Indy hung onto the bonnet of the truck only by a bending hood ornament.\n\n\n\n5. \"GoldenEye\" (Martin Campbell, 1995)   Stunt: 750 foot bungee jump  Stuntman: Wayne Michaels\n\n\n\nThis breathtaking Bond stunt was performed at the Verzasca hydro-electric dam in Switzerland and done in one take. Michaels jumped from a specially-constructed platform built to jut out from the dam to prevent him making contact with the front of the dam, which was studded with steel pegs.

Nixon, right, and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici.\n\n\n\nDuring a meeting of the two leaders at the White House on December 9 of that year, Medici was discussing the possibility of a coup by the Chilean military with assistance from Brazilian military officers when Nixon said that it was \"very important that Brazil and the United States work closely in this field,\" according to the document.\n\n\n\nNixon offered money or other discreet aid for the effort if it could be made available, the document shows.\n\n\n\n\"We must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros, and try where possible to reverse these trends,\" Nixon said. Medici said he was \"happy to see that the Brazilian and American positions and views\" were so close.\n\n\n\nThe declassified document, a previously top secret memorandum for Nixon's file written by National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, was published by the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental research institute in Washington.\n\n\n\nThe memorandum, along with other documents, were declassified in July as part of the State Department's Foreign Relations of the United States series.\n\n\n\n\"This is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the North [the United States] and the colossus of the South [Brazil],\" said Peter Kornbluh, the director of a Chile and Brazil Documentation Project for the National Security Archive. He called it \"a smoking gun of confirmation of Brazil's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of Chile and a discussion of collusion with the United States.\"\n\n\n\nThe two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols, according to the document.

And in fact, because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon, there are chapters that are blank right now,\" he said. You know that they're going to written, but we don't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove. The moon \"is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarthbound explorations, such as Lewis and Clark's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century, carry critically necessary items, but they have no need to haul wood or water. That's not so for manned space flight. Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet's surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched last summer, is the robotic scout that is providing the data. LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWargo said LRO is carrying high-resolution cameras, which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon, including the Apollo mission landing sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed, and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages, where the astronauts walked on the moon,\" according to Wargo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LRO discovered it's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters, where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, or 249 degrees below zero Celsius. That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached. These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon. Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020, the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004. But it's more than that. Wargo sum it up this way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place, that the moon was a dead planet. ... There are changes that occur there not over the course of thousands or millions or even billions of years, but are changing over the course of days and weeks and months.

The sun is setting, night is coming on quickly, and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular.\n\n\n\nReptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades.\n\n\n\n\"The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWasilewski is a state-sanctioned snake-hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles. The Everglades, known as the River of Grass, has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed.\n\n\n\nAnd breed they do: The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs.\n\n\n\nThey are also speedy travelers, able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day, experts say.\n\n\n\nThe travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver's seat of his truck. But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading.\n\n\n\n\"It's a large predator, and they're eating basically everything in sight. That's the problem,\" Wasilewski said of the Burmese python.\n\n\n\nVolunteers like Wasilewski, happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands, are not the only troops in Florida's war on the invading pythons.\n\n\n\nA \"Python Patrol\" was launched in the Florida Keys, south of the Everglades, by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy. Her program uses utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find.\n\n\n\n\"The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here,\" said Higgins, the conservation manager for the Keys.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the problem originated when reptile-breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew. Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners.\n\n\n\n\"These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,\" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle.\n\n\n\nThe state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski.\n\n\n\nTwenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure.\n\n\n\nWhat Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move.\n\n\n\nWhen he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed.\n\n\n\nOn one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty. He saw a python on the road, but it was dead, and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him.\n\n\n\nFinally, Wasilewski, an environmental and wildlife consultant, spotted something. \"Yeah, baby! Hee ha! Look at the size of this one,\" he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck.\n\n\n\nHe got out and picked up the brownish-green snake, which immediately coiled around his arm.\n\n\n\n\"This isn't a big one,\" he said, but as he got a closer look, he did not deny that it was a good one: \"At least 12 [feet.]\"\n\n\n\nWasilewski has a soft spot for these species, and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them.\n\n\n\nHe says it is not the snakes' fault that they ended up in the Everglades, but he ", "qas": [{"question": "How many in numbers are there", "id": "f3392fcd067b4e50ba6b28a937389f6b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2471, "text": "100,000"}]}, {"question": "What breeds quickly and travels quickly?", "id": "cffde012e2ae45b5bc9c6cf569ce7657", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1128, "text": "Burmese python."}]}, {"question": "What does the expert patrol?", "id": "ce020475bd42443c9a47498225879754", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1337, "text": "the Florida Keys,"}]}, {"question": "Where is a perfect place for Burmese pythons to live?", "id": "ad293f2dfc814c049ffc3d774d15033d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 505, "text": "The Everglades,"}]}, {"question": "Where is this place", "id": "9bdff30a8674448db3b028d425d6c16b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 310, "text": "Florida Everglades."}]}, {"question": "What does the reptile expert do?", "id": "0453e067ffbf4cf19accf2fb20bb7db0", "answers": [{"answer_start": 271, "text": "holds a Burmese python"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- The European Commission handed down its r", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- The European Commission handed down its ruling in a landmark anti-trust case against Intel Wednesday, fining the computer chip giant a record  $1.45 billion for abusing its dominant position in the computer processing unit (CPU) market.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday the European Commission fined Intel a record $1.45 billion for violating anti-trust laws.\n\n\n\nThe ruling, which Intel plans to appeal, may have future implications for American companies accused of \"jurisdiction shopping\" to avoid anti-trust verdicts against them, says CNN's Jim Boulden, who explains the basics of the Intel case.\n\n\n\nThe commission has hit Intel with the biggest fine ever -- what were its reasons?\n\n\n\nThe European Commission says Intel has been abusing its dominant market position in semiconductors for years. The EC says Intel has systematically given PC makers and stores rebates to keep computers with AMD chips off the shelves. AMD (another American company and Intel's only competitor) first raised the red flag in 2000.\n\n\n\nWhy does the commission have the power to impose such fines?\n\n\n\nEU law does not regard market dominance as illegal, but it is allowed to fine a company that abuses its position as the biggest in any given market. It has a guideline of fining a company based on a percentage of profits.\n\n\n\nEU law is set up to \"protect consumers,\" and the anti-trust office says consumers were hurt. Yet as Intel likes to point out, consumers did not launch this case -- AMD, a competitor, launched this in Europe (and in Japan and South Korea) as the U.S. antitrust officials under George W. Bush were unlikely to pursue a case on these merits.\n\n\n\nThe EU could fine Intel (or any company) based on 10% of global annual revenues, but chose to fine it on a smaller percentage made in the EU.\n\n\n\nCan Intel afford to pay this fine? What state is the company in at the moment?\n\n\n\nIntel reported first quarter revenue of $7 billion. It can easily afford this. Interestingly, it lost 4 percent of its market share to AMD so far this year.\n\n\n\nThe company says it will appeal -- when is that likely to be heard?\n\n\n\nAnother appeal will take months. Intel already appealed a preliminary part of this ruling last year and lost. Meanwhile, the EC can argue that Intel is still abusing its position and increase the fine during the appeals process, as it did to Microsoft.\n\n\n\nIntel is not the first tech company to be hit by the European Commission.

The decision was made just a couple of hours before the announcement, according to commission deputy Zakria Barakzai.\n\n\n\nAfghans went to the polls on August 20, in a vote marred by widespread fraud.

Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman.\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Alberto Cutie -- sometimes called \"Father Oprah\" because of the advice he gave on Spanish-language media -- said Monday on CBS' \"Early Show\" that he is in love with the woman and is considering his options: Whether to break up with her or leave the priesthood and marry her. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, wants to get married, Cutie said.\n\n\n\nThe priest was removed from his duties last week at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach, Florida, and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks.\n\n\n\n\"I take full responsibility for what I did, and I know it's wrong,\" he said Monday.\n\n\n\nThe photos of the Cuban-American priest, also known as \"Padre Alberto,\" appeared on the cover of last week's TV Notas magazine and on eight inside pages. The cover says in Spanish: \"Good God! Padre Alberto. First photos of a priest 'in flagrante' with his lover.\"\n\n\n\nOther media outlets throughout Latin America, including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico, picked up the story, and it became an Internet sensation. Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world.\n\n\n\nIn a message posted on the Miami, Florida, archdiocese Web page last week, Archbishop John C. Favalora apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a \"scandal.\"\n\n\n\n\"Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God,\" Favalora said. \"Father Cutie's actions cannot be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest.\"\n\n\n\nCutie expressed his regret in an online statement last week and again Monday on the CBS program.\n\n\n\n\"I deeply apologize to the Catholic community and especially to my bishop and to my brother priests who are faithful and who are committed to celibacy,\" Cutie said.\n\n\n\nThe priest said he believes in celibacy but thinks it should be optional. He said he had never had a sexual relationship with anyone other than the woman since leaving the seminary 15 years ago.  Watch Father Cutie question the celibacy requirement \u00bb\n\n\n\n\"I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise,\" Cutie said. \"I understand fully that this is wrong.\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to be the anti-celibacy priest. I think that's unfortunate,\" he said. \"I think it's a debate that's going on in our society, and now I've become kind of a poster boy for it. But I don't want to be that. I believe that celibacy is good, and that it's a good commitment to God. This is something I've struggled with. And something that I never expected to become a public debate.\"\n\n\n\nHe also talked about the woman, saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on, but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago. They have \"both struggled\" with the relationship, he said.\n\n\n\n\"She's also a woman of faith,\" Cutie said. \"She's also somebody who cares about the priesthood, who cares about these things. So it hasn't been easy. And those who have helped me through this process know it hasn't been easy.

In an interview with Out magazine, pop star Christina Aguilera referred to fellow superstar Lady Gaga as a \"newcomer\" who was \"fun to look at,\" but Aguilera posted a statement on her website claiming that there wasn't any malice behind those words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is very easy for comments to be taken out of context and create unnecessary drama -- especially between us women,\" Aguilera said in the statement. \"So I would like to tell you all directly so my words cannot be misconstrued to sell someone else's story. ... I have absolutely nothing against Lady Gaga or any other female artist in this business.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Aguilera noted in her statement, this isn't the first time she's \"been unfairly pitted against another female artist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Aguilera or the \"Sex and the City\" stars really are estranged from other famous women, so be it -- but why no mention of their relationship with co-stars Chris Noth or John Corbett? For that matter, where are the stories about how the male actors got along on the set?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are hardly ever any stories about male celebrities fighting,\" said celebrity blogger Vera Sweeney, who runs IAmNotObsessed.com. \"Even when Shia LaBeouf got into that car accident while on a date with Isabel Lucas -- even though she was dating Adrian Grenier at the time -- nothing happened. Adrian said they weren't serious, and the story was dropped.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, this doesn't mean that male celebrities are never pitted against one another in the media -- take a look at earlier beefs between Kid Rock and Tommy Lee, Eminem and Moby or Nas and Jay-Z.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, is that those battles are often steeped with violent overtones, and they're treated with more severity than the disputes female celebrities are rumored to have.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, Sweeney said, the \"celebrity men in conflict\" angle will be given a different spin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of there being a power struggle or an emotional issue, different work ethics will most likely be cited,\" she said. \"For example, when Christian Bale and Johnny Depp filmed 'Public Enemy' it was said that both men wanted to stay in character even when they weren't shooting. So it was understood why they weren't friendly with one another in between takes -- because they were 'in character.' If two women did that, it would be pitched as a cover-up for a more deep[ly] rooted reason.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actresses themselves seem to accept it as just another part of an oft-dirty business. \"The chemistry among the four of us is very strong, [but] ... the press has to put women in these boxes, rather than show them as the movie portrays them: working together and being powerful,\" Cattrall said in the Marie Claire interview. \"Things just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people's imaginations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA likely reason for the media coverage, explained pop culture expert and \"The Cult of Celebrity\" author Cooper Lawrence, is because \"it's much easier to believe that women don't like each other.

They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\"\n\n\n\n\"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory.\n\n\n\nOne anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese.\n\n\n\nGoogle focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules.\n\n\n\nAlthough Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International.\n\n\n\nConquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics\n\n\n\nSo what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens?\n\n\n\nWhile 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month.\n\n\n\nMoreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail.\n\n\n\nIn short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work.\n\n\n\nOne could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill.\n\n\n\nAmong the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market.\n\n\n\nTencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it.

We had a champagne breakfast to celebrate.\"\n\nHenry was the oldest tuatara ever to mate at the museum, on New Zealand's South Island, Hazley said.\n\nTuataras are the only living descendants of an order, related to dinosaurs, that flourished 200 million years ago. They're endangered, only living on a handful of islands in New Zealand, which makes Henry's happy news all the more important to supporters of the species.\n\nBut it didn't come easy.\n\nUntil about six years ago, Henry was a nasty, irritable fellow who showed no interest in mating and would attack females when they were introduced. Hazley, who has been breeding tuataras for the past 35 years, eventually had to put him in \"solitary confinement.\"\n\nBut in 2002, veterinarians discovered that a lump in Henry's nether regions was a cancerous tumor. They removed it and, over the next few years, his mood -- and interest in the ladies -- improved.\n\nNow, Henry lives peacefully with Mildred and two other females. Breeders are hoping he'll show interest in Lucy, who is about the same age as Mildred, later this year. Female tuataras only lay eggs every two or three years, so Mildred likely won't be interested.  Watch a curator take care of the reproducing dinosaur kin \u00bb\n\nHenry's newfound libido does have some limits, however. Hazley said Juliet, a youthful 22 year old, appears to be too hot to handle for the centenarian -- who could live to be 200 years old if he stays healthy.\n\n\"I think he's a bit shy to mate with such a young woman,\" Hazley said. \"After a bit of experience with Mildred and Lucy, maybe he'll be interested in Juliet next year.\"\n\nMaxing out at about two-and-a-half feet long, tuataras are much smaller than their ancestors.\n\nThe word \"tuatara\" is derived from a Maori word meaning \"spiny back.\" In Maori legend, they are messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and they were featured on one side of a New Zealand five-cent coin that was phased out in 2006.\n\nIt's been a baby boom at Southland Museum lately. Hazley said another 10 babies were born to another couple recently -- swelling the ranks of the 50 or so tuataras that were already there.\n\nFriday morning, Hazley was working to install a camera so Henry's international fan base can watch him and other tuataras on the Internet.

Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success.\n\n\n\nHe sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring.

He works currently in the fields of clean energy technology and policy and is chairman of SmartTransportation.org which successfully pushed for the use of hybrid cars as taxis in New York City.\n\n\n\nJack Hidary says the Cash for Clunkers program promotes fuel economy and safety while boosting the economy.\n\n\n\nNEW YORK (CNN) -- Our country is facing a daunting economic challenge this year and we must take steps to pull ourselves out of this ditch.\n\n\n\nOne such program that has hit the ground running is Cash for Clunkers. It's helping consumers move beyond these hard times and has reignited a whole industry.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is now working in more than 10 countries around the world. In Germany, consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done. How many other government programs can you say that about?\n\n\n\nThe Senate has joined the House in passing an additional $2 billion for Cash for Clunkers, allowing the program to move forward. This will bring additional buyers to the showroom. One key feature of the Clunkers program is that it is not just $3 billion of new money into the economy. It is injecting $21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car. That is a lot of stimulus for the dollar.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers. Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler.\n\n\n\nCash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North.\n\n\n\nSome people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry.\n\n\n\nFirst, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out.\n\n\n\nSecond, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators.\n\n\n\nGuess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.\n\n\n\nUnless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle.\n\n\n\nA family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60. Do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile-per-gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $4 a gallon?\n\n\n\nThird, Cash for Clunkers saves lives. When you bring in a clunker that has no airbags, anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does, you are protecting your family. Forty thousand people die every year on American highways and many more get serious injuries.\n\n\n\nYou can reduce ", "qas": [{"question": "What can lead to more safety and save cash?", "id": "cfcb878ce5814bc9bc167d9c2984adba", "answers": [{"answer_start": 382, "text": "fuel economy"}]}, {"question": "Which program is boosting economy and auto industry?", "id": "2032756f88a047c480c62dde0370296a", "answers": [{"answer_start": 347, "text": "Cash for Clunkers"}]}, {"question": "What did Jack Hidary say about the Cash for Clunkers program ?", "id": "5b8b16eec3b9472f93b5e0d16458de0b", "answers": [{"answer_start": 373, "text": "promotes fuel economy and safety while boosting the economy."}]}, {"question": "What is the name of the program?", "id": "581c4fe469a84f2f989aabaede600937", "answers": [{"answer_start": 347, "text": "Cash for Clunkers"}]}, {"question": "What does the  Cash for Clunkers program save?", "id": "9abd942170454e78981c5d29d713f515", "answers": [{"answer_start": 382, "text": "fuel economy and safety while boosting"}]}, {"question": "What is being saved?", "id": "57bffe27d20040699f85a6954fbb5bea", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1529, "text": "jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers."}]}, {"question": "What is the reason as to why Cash for Clunkers is saving jobs?", "id": "9206b026187f4230b610c9a05a62edad", "answers": [{"answer_start": 651, "text": "It's helping consumers move beyond these hard times and has reignited a whole industry."}]}, {"question": "What will decrease dependence on foreign oil?", "id": "9d71016ff1924e6287251e9ae657d1d8", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3174, "text": "Cash for Clunkers"}]}]}]}, {"title": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's lower house of p", "paragraphs": [{"context": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's lower house of parliament elected a woman as its speaker Wednesday, a first in the male-dominated chamber's history.\n\n\n\nMeira Kumar was nominated by the ruling Congress party.\n\n\n\nMeira Kumar is also a member of the \"untouchable\" Dalit class, the lowest rung in the centuries-old caste system in the country.\n\n\n\nThe speaker conducts the proceedings of the house.

Mark Sanford has said it's better for him to keep his governorship to \"learn lessons.\"\n\n\n\n\"For the past two days, I have been speaking with Republican leaders across South Carolina,\" she said in a statement. \"There is clearly a growing view that the time may have come for Governor Sanford to remove himself and his family from the limelight, so that he can devote his efforts full-time to repairing the damage in his personal life.\"\n\n\n\nThe statement comes on the same day as a growing number of GOP state senators called for Sanford to step down.\n\n\n\nCNN has learned that GOP Sens. Daniel Verdin, Shane Martin, Ronnie Cromer and Wes Hayes joined the anti-Sanford chorus Wednesday morning, bringing the total number of Republican senators calling for the governor's resignation to 13. There are 27 Republicans in the state Senate.\n\n\n\nAnother state senator stopped just short of calling for Sanford to step down Wednesday. Glenn McConnell, Senate president pro tempore, didn't explicitly ask Sanford to resign, but he did ask him \"to do the right thing for himself, his family and our state.\"\n\n\n\nSanford and his staff have said repeatedly this week that he will not resign. He wrote in a message to his political action committee e-mail list Monday that while he considered resigning, \"I would ultimately be a better person and of more service in whatever doors God opened next in life if I stuck around to learn lessons rather than running and hiding down at the farm.\"\n\n\n\nAfter returning last week from a secret trip to Argentina that his staff and wife didn't know about, Sanford admitted to an extramarital affair with a woman identified as Maria Belen Chapur. Sanford also told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he's \"crossed lines\" with other women, although Chapur was the only one he had sex with.

But now that officials are publicly coming out against the governor and Attorney General Henry McMaster has begun investigating Sanford's travel records, McCall said the rally may not be necessary.\n\n\n\n\"We are hoping that legislators can quietly, in private talks with the governor, ask him if he would please step down,\" McCall said.\n\n\n\nA top South Carolina Democrat also called for Sanford's resignation Wednesday. \"While I believe an investigation should still be done to determine the full extent of Mark Sanford's abuse of power, [through] his long stream of confessions he has already revealed enough immoral and reprehensible behavior to justify asking him to step [down],\" state Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"State officials seem unable to do anything except worry and talk about Governor Sanford's extramarital affair, which we learn more about every few hours.\n\n\n\n\"...

Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 \"Biscuit\" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call \"project work\" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards.

He said it wasn't really a problem until he reached college. \"I've always had my baby fat, but as I got to college I started gaining more,\" he said. \"After college, it continued. After graduate school, it continued.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvans said he was unaware of the toll the additional weight was taking on his body. His mom, Helen, said she noticed he would become breathless while completing simple tasks, but she said she was too nervous to speak up. \"I was going to say something to him about it, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Aha!\" moment: One foot stepped on a scale. Then the other. Evans, a program specialist at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, waited in anticipation as the number beneath him rose higher. And higher. And higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was 315 pounds -- a weight Evans had never dreamed of reaching, but he was forced to accept the indisputable reality that flashed before him. He never wanted to reach 400 pounds. It was time for a change, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you lost weight? Tell us about your ''Aha!'' moment on iReport\n\n\n\n\n\nHow he did it: Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather. He started doing cardio for 45 minutes, five days a week. The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind: $1,200. \"I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted,\" he said. \"I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest obstacle: Evans said his biggest obstacle was managing his time. When he changed his diet, he included several items that he didn't usually eat, and working them into his daily routine initially was a challenge. He decided to sit down on Sundays and plan his workouts and meals for the week, including when he would prepare food.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining diet: While dieting, Evan aimed to eat 1,800 calories a day. Now Evans eats five meals a day, with calorie counts totaling 2,500. Some of the items on his regimen include protein shakes, eggs, turkey, almonds, baked chicken breast and steamed veggies.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining workouts: Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week. He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes of success: His mother said she has seen a distinct change in him, and she said she is proud of her youngest son's accomplishments. \"I think he takes more pride in himself,\" she said. \"I'm proud that Kevin is taking charge of his health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts: \"You can't just go on a diet for a few months and lose weight and then go back to exactly how you were living before and expect everything to be the same,\" Evans said. \"Ironically, it seems like the older I get, the better I get. I am also more self-confident and proud that I have been able to accomplish this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor's take: Talking to loved ones about their weight can be hard. Dr. Jan McBarron, who is certified by the American Board of Bariatric Medicine, suggests approaching a friend or family member from a nonaccusatory standpoint by asking questions such as, \"How do you feel about your weight?\" Then, if he or she seems ready to change, offer to help find credible sources for weight loss information.", "qas": [{"question": "What was his reported biggest obstacle?", "id": "72db4fe2adba411abff72eab29cfaf23", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1933, "text": "time."}]}, {"question": "What did Kevin Evans buy?", "id": "3a1f5df0db9f4f55a0cd291ba708e0c2", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1325, "text": "treadmill"}]}, {"question": "Who bought a treadmill?", "id": "44ba26c0dbb346e2956a96d27ddb3ebf", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1307, "text": "Evans"}]}, {"question": "What type of eating plan did he follow?", "id": "af7d61da98fa436da3f6524e2b864b08", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1574, "text": "low-calorie meals"}]}, {"question": "How long did he work out daily?", "id": "0d29f96a620a43bd99661dbfb7072b59", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1497, "text": "45 minutes,"}]}, {"question": "How long did he workout for?", "id": "129e731f7cf548eb8ade87485fd2cbd1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1497, "text": "45 minutes, five days a week."}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN)  -- Despite the rise of the Web and its free", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN)  -- Despite the rise of the Web and its freewheeling second-by-second ferment, government efforts at control and censorship remain rife across the Middle East and North Africa, a new report said Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the Middle East and North Africa, the Internet has offered many people access to information and the outside world that would have been unimaginable a few years ago,\" according to the International Press Institute's latest report: the IPI Press Review 2009 Focus on the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, government control of the media remains tight in almost all [Middle East and North Africa] countries, and censorship and self-censorship are prevalent throughout the region.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet has emerged as a challenge to officialdom and its pronouncements and reaction from activists.

was the South African's first-ever Test series triumph in Australia and victory in the third and final match in Sydney will see them leapfrog the home side at the top of the global rankings.\n\n\n\nHashim Amla (30 not out) scored the winning runs shortly after lunch as South Africa became the first team to overcome Australia at home since the West Indies in 1992-93.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa were never under any pressure in their run chase and did not lose a wicket until just before lunch when the inspirational Smith was trapped leg before wicket by Nathan Hauritz.\n\n\n\nSmith had dominated a 121-run opening stand with Neil McKenzie, hitting 10 boundaries.\n\n\n\nMcKenzie struggled to a half century and survived strong lbw shouts from Brett Lee, who was bowling despite an injured foot that will keep him out of the Sydney Test.\n\n\n\nSouth Africa's victory was set up by a brilliant maiden Test century from JP Duminy, who shared a stunning 180-run ninth wicket partnership with pace bowler Dale Steyn.\n\n\n\nIt gave the tourists a priceless 65-run lead on first innings before man of the match Steyn worked his magic with the ball as Australia were bowled out on the fourth day for 247 in their second innings.\n\n\n\nThe pugnacious Smith was virtually lost for words in his victory speech.\n\n\n\n\"It has been such a special moment for all of us, it has been an incredible team effort,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"I have been smiling non-stop since we hit the winning runs.\n\n\n\n\"To be 2-0 up after this game was something we only dreamt of.\"\n\n\n\nSouth Africa

Shakespeare died in 1616.\n\nThe Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.\n\nThe most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.\n\nThe identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.\n\nThe portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\n\n\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\n\n\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"\n\nWells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\n\n\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"\n\nIt should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.\n\nThe public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.\n\nThe portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "qas": [{"question": "What he painted in 1610?", "id": "656256192ad14bbf9f0cbb3ee3aa052d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 27, "text": "portrait"}]}, {"question": "For how long was the painting on display?", "id": "7a1c968d39644e7eb1f0a27e3f70c70f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2776, "text": "several months starting April 23."}]}, {"question": "what hakespeare group unveil \"only\" portrait of playwright?", "id": "8af8f27867bd48a2b337b97001163115", "answers": [{"answer_start": 509, "text": "London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust."}]}, {"question": "In what year did Shakespeare die?", "id": "7027f9cf591c42c1aa99c460a581d1d1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 825, "text": "1616."}]}, {"question": "When was this painted?", "id": "5c77d779830a4f93b3261e066c7ea67d", "answers": [{"answer_start": 44, "text": "400 years ago"}]}]}]}, {"title": "(CNN) -- For a little while, it looks like \"Up,\" P", "paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- For a little while, it looks like \"Up,\" Pixar's 10th feature-length film, is going to be a downer.\n\n\n\nIn \"Up,\" a curmudgeonly senior citizen, Carl, tries to cope with the enthusiasm of Russell, a young boy.\n\n\n\nNot that there's anything wrong with an animated film tugging at our tear ducts. But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when, about five minutes into a spunky prologue, intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds, and then not-so-newlyweds.\n\n\n\nThey gray and stoop before our eyes, youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but can't have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day, that domestic disaster, until there's no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie, anyway.\n\n\n\nThat leaves us with Carl, a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner, who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And he's one of the main characters.\n\n\n\nNo, I didn't hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up, but I'll wager someone was thinking it.  Watch a preview of \"Up\" \u00bb\n\n\n\nSuch misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes, \"Up\" delivers the goods. Not penguins, precisely, but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials.\n\n\n\nThere's a mythical multicolored bird, which may or may not be a snipe, but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs, in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes.\n\n\n\nAnd there's Russell, a chubby Boy Scout -- or \"Wilderness Explorer\" -- who turns up on Carl's doorstep when he least expects it. After all, Carl wants to be free, and to get there, he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around?\n\n\n\n\"Up\" doesn't always fly high. The dogs' canine high jinks are closer to \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" than we'd expect from Pixar, which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs.\n\n\n\nBut if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy, well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell, floating well above the Earth.\n\n\n\nRussell is all wide-eyed innocence and boundless enthusiasm, haplessly helpful. He's the mirror image of the child Carl used to be, if only the old man were capable of recognizing it.\n\n\n\nBut instead of looking around him, Carl is focused on landing that prize home of his in the prime location he mistakes for his ultimate destination (the lost world of Paradise Falls). The image of Carl valiantly dragging his house through jungle and over mountains will strike a chord with anyone holding down a mortgage. iReport.com: Share your review of \"Up\"\n\n\n\nWritten by Bob Petersen and directed by Petersen and Pete Docter -- both Pixar veterans -- \"Up\" mixes allegory with adventure and dumb imaginative exuberance. The balance isn't quite as tight as in Pixar's best movies, but the lightness is appealing, and Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) is an irresistible character. He's already carrying his own emotional baggage at 8 years old, but he's all heart, the kind to give kids a good name.\n\n\n\nScreening in 3-D where possible, \"Up\" doesn't go overboard on stereoscopic gimmickry, but does exploit depth of field in a string of exhilarating cliffhangers and dogfights.\n\n\n\nFunny and poignant and full of life, \"Up\" easily qualifies as one of the best movies of the year so far. Go with someone you care about.\n\n\n\n\"Up\" is rated PG and runs 96 minutes.

For many, Dillinger's exploits represented sticking it to the fat cats, and he was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood.\n\n\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover, FBI director at the time, may have made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy No. 1, but the bandit was careful not to alienate the public.\n\n\n\nThere is a memorable moment where he drapes a coat over a female bank hostage during a raid to keep her warm. Also, it's said he never swore in front of women.\n\n\n\nHe was always courteous even as he tried to meet his target of robbing banks in under two minutes. Crucially, he never robbed the average guy, telling him to put his money away during robberies.\n\n\n\nIt is this Dillinger that Depp captures: a captivating revolutionary with the gift of  gab who lit the public's imagination, causing people to flock to cinemas to watch his exploits in weekly newsreels. Review: Depp is great in 'Public Enemies'\n\n\n\nOf course, the dark, violent side of  Dillinger's psyche is unavoidable. Depp plumbed the depths of his own character to come up with those murkier elements.\n\n\n\nThat was something that took courage, according to Mann: \"He had Dillinger in him; that's something I sensed. Deep in the core of Johnny there's a toughness.\"\n\n\n\nDepp gained recognition throughout the 1990s for immersing himself in characters. He shook off an early reputation as a teen pin-up in movies like Tim Burton's 1991 Gothic tale \"Edward Scissorhands.\"\n\n\n\nHe went on to cement his reputation for unusual film choices and quirky performances in films like \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005) and \"Finding Neverland\" (2004).  In pictures: Johnny Depp's iconic roles \u00bb\n\n\n\nThe 46-year-old actor says he felt a close affinity to Dillinger: \"I related to John Dillinger like he was a relative. I felt he was of the same blood. He reminded me of my stepdad and very much of my grandfather.\n\n\n\n\"He seemed to be one of those guys with absolutely no bull whatsoever, who lived at a time when a man was a man.\"\n\n\n\n\"Public Enemies\" was adapted by Mann from a nonfiction book of the same name by Bryan Burrough.

But the oceans, like the land, have gotten crowded, and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public-owned seas from turning into sprawling, watery versions of Houston, Texas, or Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n\n\"The oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development,\" said Amanda Leland, ocean policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. \"Even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish. We know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world.\"\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to address this and other crowding problems, governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration on June 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning. By September, the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that's designed to protect ocean ecology, address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies.\n\n\n\nA handful of states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are charting similar courses. Massachusetts on June 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters, which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year. One of the state's main aims is to make space for two ocean wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state's waters -- without angering fishing industries, killing whales or harming ecosystems.\n\n\n\nInternationally, several European countries, including Denmark, Belgium, the United Kingdom and France, are pioneering the new field, said Fanny Douvere, a co-principal investigator at UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.\n\n\n\nOcean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming.\n\n\n\nOne reason it's taken so long is that people can't see that the oceans are filling up, said Sandra Whitehouse, a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group.\n\n\n\n\"The majority of the ecosystem is under the water,\" Whitehouse said. \"So it's out of sight, out of mind. We're only looking at the surface.\"\n\n\n\nBeneath the water, though, overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse. By one report, wild fish could disappear by mid-century.\n\n\n\nThe energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water. Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales. Fish farms are growing in some countries. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry. And power lines, reefs, lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space.\n\n\n\nIn Europe's North Sea, expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available, said Douvere, of UNESCO.\n\n\n\nWhat happens on land also affects the oceans. A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year, coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near-coast fish habitat.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, pavement on land creates \"expressways\" for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean. \"Every eight months, nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill,\" the report says.\n\n\n\nWhen the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea, the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan, said Whitehouse, of the Ocean Conservancy.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy,\" she said, \"but it's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way, because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans.\"\n\n\n\nSince there are new uses but not new space, planning is necessary, said Charles Ehler, another co-principal investigator at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.

This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start.\n\n\n\nHis address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy.\n\n\n\nThat said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward.\n\n\n\nDespite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral.\n\n\n\nWith Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the \"good war.\" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help?\n\n\n\nTurkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together.\n\n\n\nReading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women.\n\n\n\nNo matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences.\n\n\n\nInstead, the Obama administration needs to think of \"victory\" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing.\n\n\n\nIndeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies.\n\n\n\nThere are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions.\n\n\n\nStill, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges ", "qas": [{"question": "What does he say about Turkey?", "id": "f3081bac0c7b4c31b5761dc00653c83e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2063, "text": "can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally.

Military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts.\n\n\n\n\"These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution, while bringing them in line with the rule of law,\" Obama said.\n\n\n\nHe said he plans to ask Congress to enact other reforms to the 2006 law.\n\n\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Arizona, applauded his former opponent.\n\n\n\n\"Today's announcement is a step -- but only a step -- toward a comprehensive detainee policy that will deal with the detainees held at Guantanamo and elsewhere in a fashion that both accords with our values and protects our national security,\" McCain said in a written statement.\n\n\n\nBut Obama's announcement infuriated some of his core supporters -- with the revisions hardly calming the concerns of groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\n\nThe ACLU chided the military commission decision as \"a striking blow to due process and the rule of law.\"\n\n\n\n\"These military commissions are inherently illegitimate, unconstitutional and incapable of delivering outcomes we can trust,\" said Anthony D. Romero, the group's executive director.\n\n\n\n\"Tweaking the rules of these failed tribunals so that they provide 'more due process' is absurd; there is no such thing as 'due process light.' \" he said. \"If the administration's proposed rules really bring these proceedings in line with constitutional requirements, there is no reason not to use our tried and true justice system. If they don't, these tribunals have no place in our democracy.\"\n\n\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States.\n\n\n\n\"First and foremost, the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States,\" Gibbs told reporters.\n\n\n\nObama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process. The review deadline is next week.\n\n\n\nGibbs said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on American soil. Nor did he disclose how many suspects would face legal proceedings under the revised commissions.

Things weren't adding up. Money appeared to be missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns, recalled one close friend, Nancy Cappelmann.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. They spent the rest of the year in Savannah, Georgia, and also had a home in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were an active, affluent couple in their mid-40s, and their absence was quickly noticed. On the evening of March 3, 2008, the evening they were to meet with their accountant, both of the Calverts' phones were turned off. Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones.   Watch an update on the case \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4, after they missed appointments and still couldn't be reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late, so when 20 minutes went by, I got worried and called his cell, but it went straight to voicemail, like it was turned off,\" Cappelmann said. She was a good friend of the couple's and worked at one of their harbor businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice and search teams scoured the island. Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Calverts' small airplane was still at the island's airport and provided no clues. Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes, a gated community six miles from where the Calverts' yacht was docked. The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look. They now say they believe the 54-year-old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company, The Club Group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared. An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 million from the Calverts and others, police said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest, slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife, authorities said. He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner.\n\n\n\n\n\nTanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions, but didn't say specifically what those actions might have been.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing, including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, police learned that Gerwing's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Gerwing were alive, Tanner said, police wouldn't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice executed search warrants on Gerwing's office, home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing's kitchen. Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends and family are offering a $65,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Calverts' disappearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice urge anyone with information about John and Elizabeth Calvert  ", "qas": [{"question": "who are growing?", "id": "4441ed963a074e97ac0045a1560efe5f", "answers": [{"answer_start": 108, "text": "friends"}]}, {"question": "Where did the couple live?", "id": "0c8cd47c97e545fb9b691546e8497d0e", "answers": [{"answer_start": 70, "text": "Hilton Head Island"}]}, {"question": "when was the last seen of John and Elizabeth?", "id": "8ef710fca1ae4712878511bcdea0af51", "answers": [{"answer_start": 644, "text": "March 3,"}]}, {"question": "Who were they suspicious of?", "id": "d06b179a42ad4291bf19955332ada7b1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 437, "text": "Dennis Ray Gerwing"}]}]}]}], "version": "1.1"}
